In this guide, we will be deploying an Apollo GraphQL server with ZEIT Now.

## Getting Started

The first step is to create a directory for the project and `cd` into it via your terminal. It can be done with the following command:

<TerminalInput>mkdir apolloserver && cd apolloserver</TerminalInput>

Next, install the `apollo-server-micro` and `graphql` packages via your terminal.

<TerminalInput>yarn add apollo-server-micro graphql</TerminalInput>

Once the dependencies are installed, go ahead and create an `index.js` file at the root of the project directory with the following code as its contents:

```js
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server-micro')

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
`

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    hello: (root, args, context) => {
      return "Hello world! It's your boy, how far now unicodeveloper"
    }
  }
}

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  introspection: true,
  playground: true
})

module.exports = server.createHandler();
```

## Deploy with Now

Create a [`now.json` configuration file](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/configuration) in the project directory and add the following content.

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [{ "src": "index.js", "use": "@now/node" }],
  "routes": [{ "src": "/.*", "dest": "index.js" }]
}
```

- The `version` property specifies [`Now 2.0`](https://zeit.co/now).
- The [`routes` property](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration#routes) allows Now to route your deployment either by using a source and destination, or by way of a source, status, and headers.
- The [`builds` property](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/builds) allows Now to use a [builder](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/builders/overview/) with a specific source target.

We used the `@now/node` [builder](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/builders/overview) to enable a Node.js deployment.

Next, deploy the app with the Now CLI.

Another option available is to deploy from GitHub with [Now for GitHub](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github/). `Now for GitHub` allows you to deploy apps as you push code to repositories that have it [installed and configured](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github/#configuration).

`Now for GitHub` provides the ability to deploy every push in branches and pull requests to preview changes live!
