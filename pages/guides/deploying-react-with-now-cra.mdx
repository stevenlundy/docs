[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular open-source JavaScript framework, maintained by Facebook, for easily creating interactive [single-page applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) (SPAs).

In this guide, we will cover how to set up a React application with [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started) (CRA) and how to deploy it with [ZEIT Now](/docs/v2).

## Step 1: Set Up Your React Project

If you want to set up a React project with configuration done and ready for you to skip straight to [developing your app](#step-3:-local-development), you can use [Now CLI](/download) to initialize a [Now-ready Create React App project](https://github.com/zeit/now-examples/tree/master/create-react-app) using the following command from your terminal:

<TerminalInput>now init create-react-app</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Initializing a Now-ready Create React Project with Now CLI.</Caption>

Alternatively, set up a React application using the [Create React App (CRA)](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) CLI tool. With this, you can generate a project to get up and running with React.

Using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), you can setup a React app with CRA with the following command in your terminal:

<TerminalInput>yarn create react-app my-react-app && cd my-react-app</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Bootstrapping a React application with Create React App through Yarn.</Caption>

If you would prefer to use another method, see the [Quick Start documentation for CRA](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started#quick-start).

## Step 2: Preparing for Development and Deployment

<Note>
  If you used <InlineCode>now init create-react-app</InlineCode> to initialize
  your application, you can skip to{' '}
  <GenericLink href="#step-3:-local-development">the next step</GenericLink>!
</Note>

For your project to build and act as you would expect, with Now, you will need to create a [`now.json` configuration file](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/configuration) to instruct Now on how to handle your application in the build phase and when being served.

Create a `now.json` file at the root of your project and place the following inside:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "name": "my-react-app",
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@now/static-build",
      "config": { "distDir": "build" }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/static/(.*)",
      "headers": { "cache-control": "s-maxage=31536000,immutable" },
      "dest": "/static/$1"
    },
    { "src": "/favicon.ico", "dest": "/favicon.ico" },
    { "src": "/asset-manifest.json", "dest": "/asset-manifest.json" },
    { "src": "/manifest.json", "dest": "/manifest.json" },
    { "src": "/precache-manifest.(.*)", "dest": "/precache-manifest.$1" },
    {
      "src": "/service-worker.js",
      "headers": { "cache-control": "s-maxage=0" },
      "dest": "/service-worker.js"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "headers": { "cache-control": "s-maxage=0" },
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

<Caption>

  static-build Builder and routes for a React application.
</Caption>

The above `now.json` file achieves the following:

- Defines a `version` property to ensure you are using the latest [Now 2.0 platform](/docs/v2/platform/overview) version.
- Defines a project `name` that your deployments will be sorted under.
- Defines a `builds` property as an array with one build step using `@now/static-build` to instruct Now to statically build the project and deploy the `build` directory. Using the `package.json` file as an entrypoint, [more on that below](#build-instruction).
- Defines a `routes` property as an array that contains `route` objects to route all files to the right place whilst providing a fallback to `index.html` for all other routes so that React can handle routing and pages internally.

### Caching React with Now Routes

The [`routes` option](/docs/v2/deployments/routes) above also contains headers for [caching](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/routing/caching/). All files in the `static` directory are cached forever in a shared cache because they have a hash assigned to them on generation. Both `service-worker.js` and `index.html` are never cached since they must always serve fresh content.

## Step 3: Local Development

When you set up a React project with Create React App's CLI tool, you would have been presented with information telling you that you can now start your local development server. To replicate the [Now environment locally](/docs/v2/development/basics/), you should add the following script to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "now-dev": "react-scripts start"
  }
}
```

The [`@now/static-build` Builder](/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/static-build-now-static-build/#local-development) supports a custom `now-dev` script that allows you to define [custom development behavior](/docs/v2/development/basics/#custom-development-environment) while gaining extra features that mimic the Now platform locally.

Now, with **just a single command**, you can simulate the Now environment locally:

<TerminalInput>now dev</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Running the Now environment locally with a single command.</Caption>

You can now start developing your React application while testing it on your local server.

With your React project set up, you are ready to deploy your app with [Now](/now).

If you have not yet installed Now, you can do so by installing the [Now Desktop app](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation/#now-desktop) which installs Now CLI automatically, or by [installing Now CLI](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation/#now-cli) directly.

## Step 4: Deploying

The next and final step is to deploy your application with a single command.

With Now, you can deploy your application to [different environments](/docs/v2/domains-and-aliases/aliasing-a-deployment/), depending on what stage your application is at; either staging or production.

To deploy to a unique alias, use the following [Now CLI](/download) command from your terminal:

<TerminalInput>now</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Deploying with Now CLI in one command.</Caption>

<Note hint>
  See more ways to deploy and alias from the{' '}
  <GenericLink href="/docs/v2/domains-and-aliases/aliasing-a-deployment/">
    Aliasing Documentation.
  </GenericLink>
</Note>

For [production deployments](/docs/v2/domains-and-aliases/aliasing-a-deployment/#production), you can deploy to an alias of your choice. To do so, add an `alias` to your `now.json` file:

```json
{
  ...
  "alias": "my-react-project"
  ...
}
```

  <InlineCode>alias</InlineCode> property. Replace the value with your own.
</Caption>

Now, deploy your project to a production environment using the following command:

<TerminalInput>now --target production</TerminalInput>

<Note>
  For optimal performance,{' '}
  <GenericLink href="/docs/v2/deployments/configuration/#regions">
    deploy your app to the closest regions
  </GenericLink>{' '}
  to where your data source or audience are located in. You can see the regions
  Now supports in the{' '}
  <GenericLink href="/docs/v2/platform/regions-and-providers">
    Regions and Providers documentation
  </GenericLink>
  .
</Note>

When complete, Now CLI will provide you with the URL your project has been deployed and aliased to. In the case above, the alias was set to `my-react-project.now.sh`.

You can view the aliased deployment from this guide here: https://my-react-project.now.sh/

<Note hint>
  Don't forget to exclude the <InlineCode>node_modules</InlineCode> folder from
  being uploaded to Now to enable faster deployment. To do that, add a{' '}
  <GenericLink href="/guides/prevent-uploading-sourcepaths-with-nowignore/">
    .nowignore
  </GenericLink>{' '}
  file to the root of the project directory and add{' '}
  <InlineCode>node_modules</InlineCode> to it.
