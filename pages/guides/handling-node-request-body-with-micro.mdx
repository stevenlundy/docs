In this guide, we will show you how to parse a [Node.js request body](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/anatomy-of-an-http-transaction/), for use inside a [serverless function](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas/) deployed to [Now](/now), without requiring a framework such as Express.

This guide assumes the request is sent with a [`Content-Type`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type) of [`application/json`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON). However, many more content types can be parsed using the [`micro` module](https://github.com/zeit/micro).

## Step 1: Creating the Function

To get started, create a project directory and `cd` into it.

Next, initialize the project with the following command:

<TerminalInput>yarn init</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Initializing a project with <GenericLink href="https://yarnpkg.com">Yarn</GenericLink>.</Caption>

After answering the questions given, you should add the only dependency required for this example, `micro`:

<TerminalInput>yarn add micro</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Adding the <InlineCode>micro</InlineCode> dependency to the project.</Caption>

To illustrate the parsing of a request body, create an `index.js` file at the root of your project directory with the following code:

```js
const { json } = require('micro')

module.exports = async (req, res) => {
  const body = await json(req)
  res.end(`Hello ${body.name}, you just parsed the request body!`)
}
```

    Node.js
  </GenericLink>{' '}
  and <GenericLink href="https://github.com/zeit/micro">Micro</GenericLink>.
</Caption>

This function takes a POST request, parses the body, and uses data from the body in the response.

The key part here is line 4. For those used to working with Express, it should be similar to accessing `req.body`.

`json`, imported from `micro` on line 1, is a function that returns the request body in the JSON format, fully parsed and ready to access inside your function.

This is illustrated in the response, as the JSON object is accessed to use the `name` property that was sent in the initial request.

## Step 2: Deploying the Function

Deploying your function to [Now](/now) is easy. First, create a [`now.json` file](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration/) in the root of your project directory with the following code:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [{ "src": "index.js", "use": "@now/node" }]
}
```

After creating your `now.json` file, you should deploy your project with **just a single command**:

<TerminalInput>now</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Deploying your project with just a single command.</Caption>

You have now created and deployed your project, all that's left to do is test that it works.

## Step 3: Sending the Request

To verify that the JSON is being parsed correctly, make a POST request to your new deployment using [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) by executing the below code inside your terminal:

<Request
  method="POST"
  url="https://your-deployments-url.now.sh/"
  headers={{
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }}
  body={{
    name: 'Reader'
  }}
/>
<Caption>

</Caption>

<Note>
  You should change the URL to match the one for your deployment given to you in
  the Now CLI.
</Note>

You will receive a response similar to the following:

<Code>Hello Reader, you just parsed the request body!</Code>

Congratulations, now you know how to parse request bodies in Node.js!

## Bonus: Understanding Why this Works

When [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v8.x/api/) receives a request, the [body](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/anatomy-of-an-http-transaction/#request-body) is in the format of a [ReadableStream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_readable).

To get the data from the stream, you need to listen to its `data` and `end` events. To do this requires a few lines of code which you would much rather not have to repeat.

By using [`micro`](https://github.com/zeit/micro), parsing [request bodies](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/anatomy-of-an-http-transaction/#request-body) is concise and straightforward as it handles everything for you, all you need to do is specify the format you want to receive the data in.
