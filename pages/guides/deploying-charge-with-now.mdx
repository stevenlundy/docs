[Charge](https://charge.js.org/) is an opinionated, zero-config static site generator written in JavaScript. Charge is fast, simple and behaves the way you expect it to.

In this guide, we will walk you through creating and [deploying](/docs/v2/deployments/basics/) a basic Charge website with [ZEIT Now](/docs/v2).

## Step 1: Set Up Your Charge Project

[Charge](https://charge.js.org/) focuses on simplicity and provides no boilerplate as a result. To get started with Charge create your project directory, let's call it `charge-app`, and `cd` into it:

<TerminalInput>mkdir charge-app && cd charge-app</TerminalInput>
<Caption>
  Creating and entering into the <InlineCode>/charge-app</InlineCode>{' '}directory.
</Caption>

Next, [initialize](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/init/) the project:

<TerminalInput>yarn init</TerminalInput>
<Caption>
  Initializing the project, this creates a <InlineCode>package.json</InlineCode>{' '}file.
</Caption>

Yarn will present some initial questions to set up your project, complete this and when done, add Charge as a [development dependency](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/add#toc-yarn-add-dev-d):

<TerminalInput>yarn add -D @static/charge</TerminalInput>
<Caption>
  Adding Charge as a development dependency to our project.
</Caption>

Now, make an addition to `package.json`, as recommended by the [Charge documentation](https://charge.js.org/usage), by adding the following `scripts` object:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "now-dev": "charge serve src",
    "build": "charge build src dist"
  }
}
```

<Caption>
  Adding development and build scripts to the{' '}
  <InlineCode>package.json</InlineCode> file.
</Caption>

These scripts enable you to run a [local development server](/docs/v2/development/basics/) with `now dev` and, as you will see later on, [build](/docs/v2/deployments/builds/) your Charge site before [deploying](/docs/v2/deployments/basics/) with `now`.

The [`@now/static-build` Builder](/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/static-build-now-static-build/#local-development) supports a custom `now-dev` script that allows you to define [custom development behavior](/docs/v2/development/basics/#custom-development-environment) while gaining extra features that mimic the Now platform locally.

## Step 2: Add Content To Your Charge Project

The following example content setup demonstrates a few of Charge's key features, notably the use of `.jsx`, `.mdx`, and using a layout component.

Firstly, create two directories, `/src` and `/src/pages` within your project directory:

<TerminalInput>mkdir src && mkdir src/pages</TerminalInput>
<Caption>
  Creating a <InlineCode>/src</InlineCode>{' '}directory with a <InlineCode>/pages</InlineCode>{' '} directory inside of it.
</Caption>

By keeping your components inside of the `/src` directory and our content inside of the `/pages` directory, this will help keep your project organized.

Next, create an `index.html.jsx` file inside the `/src` directory that will serve as the entrypoint to your Charge-powered website.

<Note>
  During the build process, Charge will remove <InlineCode>jsx</InlineCode> and
  <InlineCode>mdx</InlineCode>
  extensions, leaving you with just static <InlineCode>html</InlineCode>files.
</Note>

Now, you will need to add some some content to your index file. Use the example below, or add your own:

```jsx
export default () => {
  return <h1>Welcome to my new Charge site!</h1>
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>index.html.jsx</InlineCode> file in a Charge project.
</Caption>

Like many static site generators, Charge encourages the use of a layout component. This component will be used to define the layout of your `.mdx` pages later on.

<Note>
  Charge automatically imports React into <InlineCode>jsx</InlineCode> files so
  you don't have to.
</Note>

Create a simple `layout.html.jsx` file inside of the `/src` directory with the following content:

```jsx
export default ({ children }) => {
  return children
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>layout.html.jsx</InlineCode> file in a Charge project.
</Caption>

If, at any point, you want to see how your changes look, you can [serve them locally](/docs/v2/development/basics/) with the script you added in the first step:

<TerminalInput>now dev</TerminalInput>
<Caption>
  Starting up a local development server using a script.
</Caption>

Charge will open a new tab for you, if not you can navigate to `localhost:2468` to see the changes you make, live-reloading is enabled through [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/).

Now that you have a layout component, use it to wrap a `.mdx` file. Create a file named `about.html.mdx` inside of your `/pages` directory.

Add some content to your about page and export it inside of the layout component you created above. Your `about.html.mdx` should look similar to this:

```markdown
import Layout from '../layout.html.jsx'

Everything between the import and export in the source is **just markdown** using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)!

export default ({ children }) => <Layout>{children}</Layout>
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>about.html.mdx</InlineCode> file in a Charge project.
</Caption>

Before deploying your project, import the about page you just created by modifying your `index.html.jsx` to look like this:

```jsx
import About from './pages/about.html.mdx'

export default () => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Welcome to my new Charge site!</h1>
      <About />
    </>
  )
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>index.html.jsx</InlineCode> file in a Charge project
  that imports the About content component and uses it in the page.
</Caption>

Now that you have a simple Charge site created, you're ready to deploy with [Now](/docs/v2).

## Step 3: Deploy Your Charge Project with Now

To deploy with Now, you will need to provide a small amount of instructions on how to build your Charge project using a [`now.json` configuration file](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration) at the root of your project directory.

Create a [`now.json` file](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration) at the project root and add the following code:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "name": "my-charge-project",
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@now/static-build"
    }
  ]
}
```

<Caption>

</Caption>

The [`now.json` file](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration) allows you to achieve many things with your [deployment](/docs/v2/deployments/basics/), below is a description of what each property does:

- [`version`](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration/#version) ensures you are using the latest [Now 2.0 platform](/docs/v2/platform/overview) version
- [`name`](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration/#name) defines a project name your deployment will be known by under Now
- [`builds`](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration/#builds) provides one build step using [`@now/static-build`](/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/static-build-now-static-build/) to instruct Now to statically build the project and deploy the `dist` directory, using the `package.json` file as an entrypoint

  <Note>
    By default, Now will cache static assets in every{' '}
    <GenericLink href="/docs/v2/platform/regions-and-providers">
      region
    </GenericLink>
    , making your site fast to load wherever you are in the world.
  </Note>

Lastly, add a `now-build` script to `package.json` which will be used by the [Builder](/docs/v2/deployments/builders/overview/), [`@now/static-build`](/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/static-build-now-static-build/), to specify what command Now should run to build the site in the cloud:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "now-build": "yarn build"
  }
}
```

<Caption>
  Adding a <InlineCode>now-build</InlineCode> script to the{' '}
  <InlineCode>package.json</InlineCode> file in a Charge project.
</Caption>

Additionally, to speed up the deployment process by not uploading un-necessary files, create a [`.nowignore` file](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/ignoring-source-paths) at the root of the project:

There are three items, in this example, that you should add to the [`.nowignore` file](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/ignoring-source-paths); `/node_modules`, `/dist`, and`/tmp` - the directory Charge creates when serving content locally:

```
node_modules
tmp
dist
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>.nowignore</InlineCode> file in a Charge project.
</Caption>

Finally, deploy the application with [Now](/docs/v2/getting-started/introduction-to-now).

If you have not yet installed Now, you can do so by installing the [Now Desktop app](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation/#now-desktop) which installs Now CLI automatically, or by [installing Now CLI](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation/#now-cli) directly.

Now allows you to [deploy your project](/docs/v2/deployments/basics) from the terminal with just one command:

<TerminalInput>now</TerminalInput>
<Caption>
  Deploying an application with Now using only one command.
</Caption>

You will see a short build step in your terminal followed by the news that your Charge project has now been [deployed](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/basics/), it should look similar to this: <https://charge-example.now.sh/>

## Bonus: Omitting the `.html` Extension

Your Charge site is now deployed, but wouldn't it be great if the URL didn't show the file extension at the end?

Thankfully, Now provides an easy method to achieve this, simply add the following code to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  ...
  "routes": [{ "src": "/(.*).html", "dest": "/$1" }]
}
```

In this example, `routes` is used to rewrite paths, meaning that the `.html` extension will no longer be displayed.
