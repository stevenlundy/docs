[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is a very popular framework for creating static websites. It's fast and flexible.

In this guide, we will walk you through setting up a Hugo website and deploying it with [ZEIT Now](/now).

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Hugo Project

To [get a Hugo project running](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/), you need to install a precompiled binary on your machine. Hugo currently provides [pre-built binaries for macOS, Windows, and Linux](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).

Therefore, you can either download the appropriate version for your machine from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) or install it via your machine's package manager.

For macOS users, you can install Hugo via [Brew](https://brew.sh):

<TerminalInput>brew install hugo</TerminalInput>

For Windows users, you can install Hugo via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/):

<TerminalInput>choco install hugo-confirm</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Installing <GenericLink href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/">Hugo CLI</GenericLink> via <GenericLink href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</GenericLink>.</Caption>

Next, run the following command to create a Hugo project via the CLI:

<TerminalInput>hugo new site my-hugo-project</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Creating a new Hugo project via the CLI.</Caption>

You can add a theme to beautify the newly created site. `cd` into the `my-hugo-project` directory and run the following command to add a [theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/):

<TerminalInput>git init && git submodule add https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Download a new theme to the Hugo project.</Caption>

The next step is to activate the theme. From your terminal, add the [ananke](https://themes.gohugo.io/gohugo-theme-ananke/) theme to the `config.toml` file.

<TerminalInput>echo 'theme = "ananke"' >> config.toml</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Edit your config.toml configuration file, and add the theme</Caption>

### Create Some Content

You can add some content to the Hugo project by running the following command:

<TerminalInput>hugo new posts/my-first-post.md</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Creating a new post in the Hugo project via the CLI.</Caption>

Once you are done running the command, edit the `my-first-post.md` file and add the following content below the generated metadata:

```markdown
## Deploying Hugo with ZEIT Now
```

You can now see your project running locally with the following command:

<TerminalInput>hugo server -D</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Running the server locally with drafts enabled</Caption>

## Step 2: Deploying Your Hugo Website with Now

Your Hugo website is ready for deployment. Create a [`now.json` configuration file](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/configuration) in the project directory and add the following content.

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "name": "my-hugo-project",
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "build.sh",
      "use": "@now/static-build",
      "config": { "distDir": "public" }
    }
  ]
}
```

<Caption>

  project.

The `now.json` file allows you to achieve a few things with your deployment:

- Defines a `version` property to ensure you are using the latest [Now 2.0 platform](/docs/v2/platform/overview) version.
- Defines a project `name` that your deployments will be sorted under and known by under Now.
- The [`builds` property](/docs/v2/deployments/builds) allows Now to use a [Builder](/docs/v2/deployments/builders/overview/) with a specific source target. We used the [`@now/static-build`](/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/static-build-now-static-build/) to build and deploy a static project. This module takes the `build.sh` file as the entry point in this case, executes the commands inside the shell file, and exposes the resulting `public` directory as the [build output](/docs/v2/deployments/builds/#sources-and-outputs) for serving.
- The [`distDir` option](/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/static-build-now-static-build/#configuring-the-build-output-directory) in the build step instructs Now to identify `public` as the static folder and build output directory.

Now, create the `build.sh` file in the `my-hugo-project` root directory and add the following code to it:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

curl -L -O https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.55.6/hugo_0.55.6_Linux-64bit.tar.gz
tar -xzf hugo_0.55.6_Linux-64bit.tar.gz

./hugo
```

  and run Hugo on Now
</Caption>

And with this configuration set up, you can now deploy your Hugo project.

<Note>
  Before deploying, ensure the <InlineCode>draft</InlineCode> value in your{' '}
  <InlineCode>my-first-post.md</InlineCode> file is set to{' '}
  <InlineCode>false</InlineCode>. If it remains as <InlineCode>true</InlineCode>,
  the content of your posts won't show up in production.
</Note>

If you have don't have [Now CLI](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation#now-cli) on your system, you can install it via the [Now Desktop](https://zeit.co/download), which is the easiest way to get started with Now. You can also install the Now CLI with `npm` as follows: `npm install -g now`.

Then, you can deploy from your terminal with just one command:

<TerminalInput>now</TerminalInput>

Otherwise, if you want your application to deploy automatically, you can [install the Now for GitHub app](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github/) and have updates for your GitHub repository deploy and alias on every push.

When your app is deployed, you will receive a deployment URL like the following: <https://my-hugo-project-9c5t1giwu.now.sh/>
