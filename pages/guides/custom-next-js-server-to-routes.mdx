Next.js offers developers [a built-in routing system](https://nextjs.org/docs/#routing) that allows you to link to other pages whilst also giving those pages a custom URL. When a user refreshes the custom URL, however, the browser will not be able to load the link because the page was previously routed client-side. To resolve this, we need to also handle routing server-side.

## Preface: Next.js Routing

When you [link to a page](https://nextjs.org/docs/#routing) within the same Next.js application, you can provide two options. The first and required option is `href`. This is a link to the page as it exists in the `pages` directory. The second is `as` which describes the URL Next.js should show when routing to that page.

For example, if you have a page located at `pages/product.js` in your codebase, you can use the `href` option with the value `/product?name=<product_name>` to route and render that page with a query parameter, however, if you want to show the URL `/product/<product_name>`, you can use the `as` option to format the URL when routing.

This is an amazing feature of Next.js, however, it cannot control how the server routes to the application if the routes are not defined with the server.

### The Old Custom Server Method

The solution to this problem was previously using a custom server. For example, you could create an Express application and catch the request to `/product/<product_name>` and route it to the `/product?name=<product_name>` file behind the scenes so that you can keep the custom URL:

```js
server.get('/products/:name', (req, res) => {
  return app.render(req, res, '/product', { name: req.params.name })
})
```

### The New Routes Method

With [Now 2.0](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/platform/upgrade-to-2-0/) and the serverless approach, each [Next.js page](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/next-js-now-next/) is a separate entry point, making the sole custom server entry point a thing of the past for the good of performance and stability. Fortunately, Now 2.0 offers a solution, by way of the `routes` configuration.

The following [`now.json` configuration](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration) enables the deployment to use the [Now platform version 2.0](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/platform/overview/#versioning) and defines [the routes](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration#routes) that the deployment should acknowledge when receiving a request to an entry point.

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/product/(?<name>[^/]+)$", "dest": "/product?name=$name" }
  ]
}
```

## By Example

If you are yet to set up routing for [your Next.js app](https://nextjs.org/docs/#setup), this brief example describes how to use Next.js routing with Now `routes` to support custom URLs.

### Step 1: Defining Pages

The first part of creating defined routes is to make sure those routes can be rendered as pages. In this example, we will have two pages, "index" (our homepage) and "product".

The `index.js` inside of our `pages` directory is just a small page that exports a heading and a paragraph of text with a link to our future products page using a [Next.js Link component](https://nextjs.org/docs/#with-link):

```jsx
import Link from 'next/link'

export default () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Welcome to our Next.js website!</h1>
    <p>
      View our{' '}
      <Link href="/product?name=espresso">
        <a>espresso product</a>
      </Link>
      !
    </p>
  </div>
)
```

<Note>
  In a real application, the product name query parameter would most likely be
  dynamic based on other factors, but for simplicity, we'll use "espresso" as
  the product name.
</Note>

Next, for our link to work, we need to create a `product.js` file in our `pages` directory. This page displays the query parameter, which we receive with the [Next.js `getInitialProps` lifecycle method](https://nextjs.org/docs/#fetching-data-and-component-lifecycle), as the title and a simple paragraph:

```jsx
const Product = ({ name }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>{name}</h1>
    <p>Welcome to our product page for {name}!</p>
  </div>
)

Product.getInitialProps = async ({ query }) => {
  return { name: query.name }
}

export default Product
```

### Step 2: Defining a Custom URL

With the pages set up, we can now define the product page to have a custom URL.
The first part of this is to extend the `Link` component usage in the index page to contain an `as` attribute that defines our custom URL. Taking the line consisting of a paragraph and a Next.js link in the `index.js` file, we can add the `as` attribute with a custom URL.

```diff
import Link from 'next/link'

export default () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Welcome to our Next.js website!</h1>
-   <p>View our <Link href="/product?name=espresso"><a>espresso product</a></Link>!</p>
+   <p>View our <Link href="/product?name=espresso" as="/product/espresso"><a>espresso product</a></Link>!</p>
  </div>
)
```

<Caption>
  A{' '}
  <GenericLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_comparison">
    diff
  </GenericLink>{' '}
  of the changes made to the <InlineCode>index.js</InlineCode> page file.
</Caption>

Now, clicking the espresso product link will result in the URL path being `/product/espresso` while rendering the `product` page with the name query parameter set to `espresso`.

### Step 3: Defining `routes` configuration

<Note>
  The prerequisite for this configuration is to host your Next.js application on
  Now.{' '}
  <GenericLink href="/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/next-js-now-next/">
    Read the @now/next Builder documentation
  </GenericLink>{' '}
  to get started.
</Note>

When refreshing the URL with the path of `/product/espresso`, or accessing it directly, you will find that the server will return a 404 response. This is because there is no entry point that exists for that path. Next.js handles the routing to that page internally on the client-side. The next step is to provide Now with the context of this path to route to the `/product` page entry point.

For this context, we can use [the `routes` configuration option](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration#routes) inside of a `now.json` file:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/product/(?<name>[^/]+)$", "dest": "/product?name=$name" }
  ]
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> configuration that rewrites our
  custom path to the product page with a query parameter.
</Caption>

<Note>
  The above configuration omits the <InlineCode>builds</InlineCode> property
  which is necessary for Now to build and serve a Next.js application. Please
  see{' '}
  <GenericLink href="/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/next-js-now-next/#how-to-use-it">
    the Next.js Builder documentation
  </GenericLink>{' '}
  for more information.
</Note>

The routes property, as exampled above, allows us to define a [named capture group](https://www.pcre.org/original/doc/html/pcrepattern.html#SEC16) that gets the query parameter from the URL path and enables the usage of that parameter in the destination path by using the capture ID prefixed by a dollar sign, in our case: `$name`.

### Step 4: Deploying

With the Next.js application setup complete and Now configured to accept the custom routes, we can finally deploy our application [using Now](/docs) and [the Next.js Builder](/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/next-js-now-next/).

If you are using [Now for GitHub](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github/); pushing your code to your repository is all you need to do for Now to automatically deploy your application.

Once you deploy, you will receive a deployment URL, similar to the following which contains this example with a few styling tweaks for ease on the eyes: <https://next-routes-2s2lop08x.now.sh/>
