Angular is a popular JavaScript framework for building applications across all platforms; web, mobile web, native mobile, and native desktop.

In this guide, we will deploy an Angular application with [ZEIT Now](/docs/v2) like the following: <https://tour-of-heroes-he3j9k80n.now.sh/>

## Step 1: Set Up Your Angular Project

The most straightforward way to set up an Angular project is to use the [official Angular CLI tool](https://angular.io/cli). The CLI tool interactively generates an Angular application that works out of the box.

If you don't have the Angular CLI installed globally, use the following command to install it:

<TerminalInput>yarn global add @angular/cli</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Installing Angular CLI global to the system user with <GenericLink href="https://yarnpkg.com">Yarn</GenericLink>.</Caption>

Once the installation is complete, run the following command in your terminal to create a new Angular app:

<TerminalInput>ng new my-new-app</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Creating a new Angular application within a terminal.</Caption>

Once you run the command, the Angular CLI presents the following options:

- Adding Angular Routing to the project.
- The Stylesheet format to add to the project: `css`, `sass`, `less`, `stylus`.

For the first option, if you choose `Yes`, the CLI tool adds [routing](https://angular.io/guide/router) automatically to the project. Then, you can select your preferred stylesheet format for the second option. Once selected, Angular CLI provides the selected stylesheet format for the project.

After a successful scaffolding, `cd` into `my-new-app` directory and run the following command to serve your app in the browser:

<TerminalInput>ng serve --open</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Running your Angular application locally</Caption>

Your browser will automatically be launched with the served Angular app at <http://localhost:4200/>

## Step 2: Deploy Your Angular Project with Now

With your Angular application set up, it is ready to deploy live with [Now](/docs/v2).

First, you need to provide Now with instructions on how to build your Angular project using [a `now.json` configuration file](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration):

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "name": "my-new-app",
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@now/static-build"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(assets/.+|.+\\\\.css|.+\\\\.js)",
      "headers": { "cache-control": "max-age=31536000,immutable" },
      "dest": "/$1"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*).html",
      "headers": { "cache-control": "public,max-age=0,must-revalidate" },
      "dest": "/$1.html"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "headers": { "cache-control": "public,max-age=0,must-revalidate" },
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

<Caption>

  project and caches the assets.
</Caption>

The `now.json` file allows you to achieve a few things with your deployment:

- Defines a `version` property to ensure you are using the latest [Now 2.0 platform](/docs/v2/platform/overview) version.
- Defines a project `name` that your deployments will be sorted under and known by under Now.
- Defines a `builds` property as an array with one build step using `@now/static-build` to instruct Now to statically build the project and deploy the `dist` directory. Using the `package.json` file as an entrypoint, more on that below.
- Defines a `routes` property as an array that contains route objects to route all files to the right place whilst providing a fallback to `index.html` for all other routes so that Angular can handle routing and pages internally.

The `routes` property in the `now.json` configuration file contain [cache-control headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control) for [caching](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/routing/caching/) our application assets. With this set up, your site is delivered faster to users with reduced bandwidth costs.

For the build property that you configured, add a `now-build` script in the generated `package.json` file to specify what command Now will run to build the app in the cloud.

```json
{
    "scripts": {
      ...
      "now-build": "ng build --prod --output-path dist"
    },
}
```

<Caption>

  projects.

If you have not yet installed Now, you can do so by installing the [Now Desktop app](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation/#now-desktop) which installs Now CLI automatically, or by [installing Now CLI](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation/#now-cli) directly.

<Note>
  Don't forget to exclude the <InlineCode>node_modules</InlineCode> folder from
  being uploaded to Now to enable faster deployment. To do that, add a{' '}
  <GenericLink href="/guides/prevent-uploading-sourcepaths-with-nowignore/">
    .nowignore
  </GenericLink>{' '}
  file to the root of the project directory and add{' '}
  <InlineCode>node_modules</InlineCode> to it.
</Note>

Then, you can deploy from your terminal with just one command:

<TerminalInput>now</TerminalInput>

If you want your application to deploy automatically, you can [install the Now for GitHub app](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github/) and have updates for your GitHub repository deploy and alias on every push.

When your app is deployed, you will receive a deployment URL like the one that was shown at the beginning of this guide: <https://tour-of-heroes-he3j9k80n.now.sh/>

<Note>
  We used the{' '}
  <GenericLink href="https://angular.io/generated/zips/toh-pt6/toh-pt6.zip">
    official Angular Tour of Heroes tutorial app
  </GenericLink>{' '}
  for the deployment. Download, extract and follow this guide to deploy.
