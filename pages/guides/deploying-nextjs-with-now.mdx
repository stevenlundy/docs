This guide will help you get started using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with [Now](/now) by covering a variety of topics from [Installing Now](#installing-now) to deploying your Next.js application **with a single command**.

Next.js is a framework, created by [ZEIT](https://zeit.co), for creating production-ready and lightning fast React applications with a lot of handy features built-in.

## Installing Now

<Note>
  If you already have Now installed, you can{' '}
  <GenericLink href="#creating-the-project">skip this step</GenericLink>.
</Note>

To get started with Now, you must first install it. For your convenience, we have provided multiple options for installation, including the **Now Desktop** app, or **Now CLI** with **Yarn**, **npm**, or **Curl**.

You can find installation instructions for all the available options on the [download page](/download).

#### GitHub and GitLab Integrations

To enhance your development experience with Now further, with automatic deployments, aliasing, and more, we also provide integrations with both [GitHub](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github/) and [GitLab](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-gitlab/).

For more information, the links above outline the key features and the **benefits our Git integrations bring to your workflow**.

## Step 1: Creating the Project

To get started, create a project directory and `cd` into it:

<TerminalInput>mkdir my-nextjs-project && cd my-nextjs-project</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Creating an entering into the <InlineCode>my-nextjs-project</InlineCode> project directory.</Caption>

With the project directory created, initialize the project like so:

<TerminalInput>yarn init -y</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Initializing your project with a <InlineCode>package.json</InlineCode> file.</Caption>

<Note>
  Using the <InlineCode>-y</InlineCode> flag will initialize the created{' '}
  <InlineCode>package.json</InlineCode> file with{' '}
  <GenericLink href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/creating-a-package#toc-creating-your-first-package">
    these
  </GenericLink>{' '}
  default settings.
</Note>

Next, add the project dependencies:

<TerminalInput>yarn add next react react-dom</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Adding <InlineCode>next</InlineCode>, <InlineCode>react</InlineCode> and <InlineCode>react-dom</InlineCode> as dependencies to your project.</Caption>

With your project setup, create a `/pages` folder:

<TerminalInput>mkdir pages</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Creating a <InlineCode>/pages</InlineCode> folder in your project.</Caption>

Inside your `/pages` folder, create an `index.js` file with the following content:

```jsx
import Head from 'next/head'

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <main>
      <Head>
        <title>Next.js on Now</title>
      </Head>
      <h1>Next.js on Now</h1>
      <h2>
        Developed & Deployed with{' '}
        <a
          href="https://zeit.co/docs"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
        >
          ZEIT Now
        </a>
        !
      </h2>
      <style jsx>{`
        main {
          font-family: 'SF Pro Text', 'SF Pro Icons', 'Helvetica Neue',
            'Helvetica', 'Arial', sans-serif;
          padding: 20px 20px 60px;
          max-width: 680px;
          margin: 0 auto;
          font-size: 16px;
          line-height: 1.65;
          text-align: center;
        }
        h1 {
          margin-top: 70px;
          font-size: 45px;
        }
        a {
          cursor: pointer;
          color: #0076ff;
          text-decoration: none;
          transition: all 0.2s ease;
          border-bottom: 1px solid white;
        }
        a:hover {
          border-bottom: 1px solid #0076ff;
        }
      `}</style>
    </main>
  )
}
```

Lastly, create a `next.config.js` file at the root of your project, this file tells Next.js to target a serverless build environment:

```js
module.exports = {
  target: 'serverless'
}
```

<Caption>

### Adding `now.json` and `.nowignore`

To provide [configuration for your project](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration/), you should use a `now.json` file.

Create a `now.json` file at the root of your project with the following code:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "alias": "my-aliased-nextjs-project",
  "name": "my-nextjs-project"
}
```

<Caption>
  A <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file to configure your project.
</Caption>

The `now.json` file achieves a few things:

- `version` - specifies which [Now platform version](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration/#version) to use for the [deployment](/docs/v2/deployments/basics/)
- `alias` - used to [alias deployments](/docs/v2/domains-and-aliases/aliasing-a-deployment/) when using a [Git integration](/guides/deploying-nextjs-with-now#github-and-gitlab-integrations)
- `name` - provides a [prefix](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration#name) for your [deployments](/docs/v2/deployments/basics/)

The `.nowignore` file works similarly to a `.gitignore` file and is used to tell the [Now CLI](/download), [Now for GitHub](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github/), and [Now for GitLab](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github/) integrations to [not upload certain files or directories](/docs/v2/deployments/ignoring-source-paths/).

Create a `.nowignore` file in the root of your project directory with the following code:

<Code>yarn.lock</Code>
<Caption>A <InlineCode>.nowignore</InlineCode> file for your Next.js project.</Caption>

Now that you've provided some configuration for your Next.js project, let's see in the next step **how to build your files for the output**.

### Adding a Builder

[Builders](docs/v2/deployments/builders/overview/) provide the step that turns your source code into [production-ready outputs](/docs/v2/deployments/builds/#sources-and-outputs).

These outputs can be either static files and/or [Lambdas](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas/). **Both output types** get served by our [CDN at the Edge](/docs/v2/domains-and-aliases/cdn/), making your deployments **blazing fast to access around the globe**.

For this project, you will require the use of a single Builder, [`@now/next`](/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/next-js-now-next/). To get started with the Next.js Builder, add the following code to your `now.json` file:

```json
{
  ...
  "builds": [
    { "src": "next.config.js", "use": "@now/next" }
  ]
}
```

<Caption>
  Adding a Builder to your projects' <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file.
</Caption>

## Step 2: Local Development

For a **seamless local development experience**, you should use `now dev`, a reproduction of the [Now deployment environment](/docs/v2/deployments/basics/) but on your local machine.

As hinted at above, you can start [developing locally](/docs/v2/development/basics/) with **just a single command**:

<TerminalInput>now dev</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Starting a local development server with the  <InlineCode>now dev</InlineCode> command.</Caption>

After shortly installing and setting up the required [Builders](/docs/v2/deployments/builders/overview/), `now dev` will start from localhost on port 3000, if available, else the next available port.

`now dev` watches your files for any changes, automatically updating when any are made, leaving you free to focus on developing your application.

## Step 3: Cloud Deployment

When you're happy with your project and ready to share it with the world, it is time to **deploy with Now**.

Just like `now dev`, [cloud deployment](/docs/v2/deployments/basics/) is handled with **just a single command**:

<TerminalInput>now</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Deploying your project with the <InlineCode>now</InlineCode> command.</Caption>

After your project has been built and deployed, you will **receive a deployment URL** with the following format:

<Code>project-name.account-name.now.sh</Code>
<Caption>An example deployment URL for your project.</Caption>

Your project is **live at this URL immediately**, allowing it to be shared with no delay.

## Further Examples

You can see more examples of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) on [Now](/now) at the Now Examples [GitHub repository](https://github.com/zeit/now-examples).

Below is a list of all Next.js examples available:

- [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/now-examples/tree/master/nextjs)
- [Next.js Static](https://github.com/zeit/now-examples/tree/master/nextjs-static)
- [Next.js News](https://github.com/zeit/now-examples/tree/master/nextjs-news)
- [Next.js + MySQL](https://github.com/zeit/now-examples/tree/master/nextjs-mysql)

These examples show how Next.js can be used with Now in a variety of different situations.

You can **get your project started in seconds** by building on top of these examples with the help of `now init`:

<TerminalInput>now init</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Using the <InlineCode>now init</InlineCode> command to create a project from an example.</Caption>

After entering the `now init` command, you will be presented with a list of projects to choose from the Now Examples [GitHub repository](https://github.com/zeit/now-examples).

All of these examples are **immediately ready** for either [local development](/docs/v2/development/basics/) or [cloud deployment](/docs/v2/deployments/basics/) to help you get your project up and running **as quick as possible**.
