When there is a new release of the [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download#now-cli) available, you will see a message appear in your terminal output when running Now, letting you know that there is a newer version.

This guide will take you through your options for updating Now CLI and how to stay up-to-date.

## Option 1: Now Desktop

If you have Now Desktop installed, you need not do anything more than to let Now Desktop update Now CLI for you.

Now Desktop comes packaged with Now CLI and updates it automatically.

To have automatic updates to Now CLI using Now Desktop, ensure that automatic updates are enabled from Now Desktop's settings menu:

  src={`${
    process.env.IMAGE_ASSETS_URL
  }/blog/improved-cli-updates/update-option.png`}
  width={385}
  height={228}
/>

As long as the update option is enabled, you will automatically receive the latest update for the [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download#now-cli), as they are released.

If you don't have Now Desktop installed yet and would prefer to have automatic updates for Now CLI, you can [install it here](https://zeit.co/download#now-desktop).

## Option 2: Updating Now CLI Manually

To update to the latest version of Now CLI yourself, you can use a package manager, such as [Yarn](#updating-with-yarn) or [npm](#updating-with-npm).

We do, however, recommend that you install [Now Desktop](#option-1:-now-desktop) for automatic updates to Now CLI.

  If you do not have Now CLI installed yet, see our{' '}
