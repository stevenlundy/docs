When there is a new release of the [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download#now-cli) available, you will see a message appear in your terminal output when running Now, letting you know that there is a newer version.

This guide will take you through your options for updating Now CLI and how to stay up-to-date.

## Option 1: Now Desktop

Now Desktop updates Now CLI automatically when there is an update to install, so you never have to think about it again.

Now Desktop also lets you:

- Create deployments with drag-and-drop
- View your teamâ€™s event feed

To have automatic updates to Now CLI using Now Desktop, ensure that automatic updates are enabled from Now Desktop's settings menu:

<Image
  src={`${
    process.env.IMAGE_ASSETS_URL
  }/blog/improved-cli-updates/update-option.png`}
  width={385}
  height={228}
/>

As long as the update option is enabled, you will automatically receive the latest update for the [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download#now-cli), as they are released.

If you don't have Now Desktop installed yet and would prefer to have automatic updates for Now CLI, you can [install it here](https://zeit.co/download#now-desktop).

## Option 2: Updating Now CLI Manually

As of version 15.4.0 of Now CLI, you can **update Now CLI with a single command**:

<TerminalInput>now update</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Updating Now CLI with the <InlineCode>update</InlineCode> command.</Caption>

To update to the latest version of Now CLI yourself, you can use a package manager, such as [Yarn](#updating-with-yarn) or [npm](#updating-with-npm).

We do, however, recommend that you install [Now Desktop](#option-1:-now-desktop) for automatic updates to Now CLI.

<Note>
  If you do not have Now CLI installed yet, see our{' '}
  <GenericLink href="/download">download page</GenericLink>.
</Note>

If you have not yet updated to a version that supports the above command, you can also use any of the following methods:

- Using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), for the latest Now CLI update, run the following command from your terminal:

  <TerminalInput>yarn global add now</TerminalInput>

- Using [npm](https://npmjs.com), for the latest Now CLI update, run the following command from your terminal:
  <TerminalInput>npm install -g now</TerminalInput>
