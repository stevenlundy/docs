## Why Build or Use an Integration?

Integrations are perfect for you if you want to pair ZEIT's functionality with other services or want to extend ZEIT's functionality itself.

An example of this is the [Google Cloud Integration](/integrations/gcloud) which connects projects on ZEIT to Google Cloud Platform projects where you can run Now deployments as CRON jobs through the Google Cloud Scheduler, Create and connect to MySQL/PostgreSQL databases with Google Cloud SQL, and much more that would be a lot harder without an Integration.

Many more Integrations that help users in similar ways can be created using the ZEIT Integrations API in partnership with the ZEIT API and any external service with an API.
