## OAuth Support

With our OAuth support, you can connect your app with ZEIT or provide "login with ZEIT" functionality.

Every ZEIT Integration is a full-fledged OAuth app. You can add the **redirect URL** when either creating or editing an Integration, this will provide you with OAuth credentials.

You can then follow our [OAuth API reference](/docs/api#endpoints/oauth2) to build an OAuth Integration.
