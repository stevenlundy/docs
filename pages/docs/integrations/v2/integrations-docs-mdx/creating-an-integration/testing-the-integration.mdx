## Step 5: Testing Your Integration

Now you know how to create, develop, and add a configuration for an Integration, it's time to look at how you to test your Integration and develop it locally.

With your Integration running locally [using `now dev`](/docs/v2/development/basics), navigate to the [Integrations dashboard](/dashboard/integrations/) and select a configuration for your Integration.

You should now see your Integration working exactly as it would do if deployed, **nothing else is required!**
