## Background

A [UIHook](/docs/integrations#understanding-uihooks) accepts a set of inputs, such as a `token` or `projectId`, and sends back a string of HTML, including [components](#component-catalog), as the response.

The [components](#component-catalog) are sent as a string. It's just like a HTML page but with a set of [rich components](#component-catalog/) we have defined and exposed for you to use.

Therefore, it is the role of the UIHook to create that HTML string. This is achieved through the use of string manipulation.

With JavaScript template literals, this is relatively straightforward. However, there are a few things to be aware of:

- Escaping prop names and values
- Escaping the content that goes into components
- No [array.map()](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#rendering-multiple-components) support
- Difficult to share common components across different Integrations and teams
