## Terminology

There are some very specific terms used in relation to UIHooks, those being:

- "Integration": This is an Integration created using the ZEIT Dashboard. This is the what a user installs
- "Configuration": A single instance where a user added an Integration to an account (user or a team)
- "UIHook": An Integration can render UI elements. These UI elements are requested from a HTTP endpoint defined in the Integration's implementation. The HTTP endpoint is called a UIHook
