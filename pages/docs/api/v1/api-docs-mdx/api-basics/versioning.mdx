## Versioning

We try to avoid breaking backwards-compatibility as much as possible.

In the rare event that we would need to change an endpoint in a very substantial way, we simply will introduce an alternative way of accessing the resource, under a different path.

Some API endpoints, however, are flagged as **EXPERIMENTAL**. If this is the case, we might deprecate or change the shape of the response over time by appending a version prefix. For example, `/create` might evolve into `/v2/create`. When the experimental status is removed, so is the prefix.
