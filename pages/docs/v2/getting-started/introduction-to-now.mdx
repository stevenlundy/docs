### Try Now

The following example highlights the ease with which you can deploy static assets (like with the `index.html` and `style.css` files below) combined with a Lambda (`date.js`) that executes and produce a dynamic response.

<Introduction />

Deploy the simple application above and get instantly redirected to your new deployment. Edit the code to see your changes live and then get started with your applications locally using the same power.

### Get Started

To learn more and get the most out of Now we recommend that you install one of our clients.

They will give you complete control over your account and enable you to instantly [deploy applications](/docs/v2/deployments/basics), [assign custom domain names](/docs/v2/domains-and-aliases/aliasing-a-deployment) and much more.
