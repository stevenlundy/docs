}

The following headers are included in Now deployments and indicate certain factors of the environment:

## `now: 1`

This header is used for identifying a response coming from [the Now platform](/docs/v2/platform/overview/).

## `server: now`

Similar to [`now: 1`](#now:-1). This header can be overridden by other proxies (e.g., Cloudflare).

## `x-now-cache`

This header's value indicates whether the response was served from ZEIT's edge cache.

The following values are possible when the content being served [is static](/docs/v2/routing/caching#caching-static-files) or uses [a `Cache-Control` header](/docs/v2/routing/caching#caching-lambda-responses).

| Value                                      | Description                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <RequestHeader>HIT</RequestHeader>         | The response was served from the edge.                                                                                                           |
| <RequestHeader>MISS</RequestHeader>        | The response was not found in the edge and so was fetched from [an origin server](/docs/v2/platform/regions-and-providers/).                     |
| <RequestHeader>BYPASS</RequestHeader>      | The cache was bypassed and so the response was served from an origin server.                                                                     |
| <RequestHeader>EXPIRED</RequestHeader>     | The entry in the cache has expired. The response is served from an origin server.                                                                |
| <RequestHeader>STALE</RequestHeader>       | The response from the cache is outdated but another visitor has already requested the response and the edge node is processing the revalidation. |
| <RequestHeader>UPDATING</RequestHeader>    | The response is stale as the entry is currently being updated due to a previous request.                                                         |
| <RequestHeader>REVALIDATED</RequestHeader> | The response from the cache was stale but it was revalidated by checking `If-Modified-Since` or `If-None-Match` headers.                         |

## `x-now-id`

The unique identifier for each request.

## `x-now-trace`

Contains a list of [our data centers](/docs/v2/platform/regions-and-providers/) through which the request has traversed, usually the data center closest to you.

<Note>
  The trace is where a request was processed, it is not necessarily where a
  lambda was executed, this could be different if you defined{' '}
  <InlineCode>regions</InlineCode> in your
  <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file.
</Note>

# Custom Headers

In addition to regular [HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers) and Now headers, it is also possible to supply your own custom headers.

Custom headers are added in the same way regular headers are, by making an addition to the `routes` property in your `now.json` file.
