In order to give you the best possible insight into what exactly is wrong with your deployment, we implemented several status codes into the [Routing Layer](/docs/v2/routing/overview) of Now.

## Response Types

By default, browsers (and any other client that sets the [`Accept`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept) header to a value containing `text/html`) will receive the status codes as the following HTML template:

<Image
  src={`https://assets.zeit.co/image/upload/v1541618244/front/docs/routing/status-codes/preview.png`}
  width={1364 / 2}
  height={818 / 2}
/>

Depending on your status code, the title ("404"), description ("The page could not be found") and the code ("FILE_NOT_FOUND") will vary.

However, if your client is sending the `Accept` header with a value that contains `application/json`, it will receive the same error, but formatted as [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON):

```json
{
  "status": "FILE_NOT_FOUND",
  "description": "The page could not be found"
}
```

Assuming that your client is not sending the `Accept` header at all, we will default to sending the description of the status code in the `text/plain` format (plain text):

```
The page could not be found
```
