## Missing Public Directory

If your project contains a `package.json` file with a `build` [script](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts), and no `now.json` configuration, it is expected to output its static files into a directory named `public`, at the root of the project, when the `build` [script](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) is executed.

You are seeing this error because your setup did not satisfy the above constraint.

To resolve this error, configure your project to place its static output files into a `public` directory, at the root of your project, when the `build` [script](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) from your `package.json` file is invoked.

For example, this is how your `package.json` file might look:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "my-framework build"
  }
}
```

If you are seeing this error with a similar `build` script already, you may need to adjust the command to direct its static output files into the `public` directory instead.

Depending on your framework, the option for this might be called `--output`, `--out`, `--output-dir` or similar:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "my-framework build --output public"
  }
}
```

Once you have done this, the error will disappear since the output will be the expected directory, `public`.

## Missing Build Script

If your project contains a `package.json` file, no `api` directory, and no `now.json` configuration, it is expected to provide a `build` [script](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) that performs a static build of your frontend and outputs it to a `public` directory at the root of your project.

When properly configured, your `package.json` file would look similar to this:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "my-framework build --output public"
  }
}
```

Once you have defined the `build` [script](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts), this error will disappear. Furthermore, it will not be displayed if you are using `package.json` purely to provide dependencies for your serverless functions located inside the `api` directory.

## Platform Version Detection

[Now CLI](/download) will automatically upgrade your deployment to the latest platform version if you create a new project or if your project meets certain criterias. In order for this to work, you must:

- Remove any Dockerfile.
- Remove the `type` property from your `now.json` file.
- Remove the `start` script from your `package.json` file.
- Remove the `server.js` file from the root of your project.

It is possible to opt out of this behavior by creating a `now.json` file with a `version` property.

If you are yet to upgrade to the latest platform version, please read our [upgrade guide](https://zeit.co/guides/migrate-to-zeit-now/).
