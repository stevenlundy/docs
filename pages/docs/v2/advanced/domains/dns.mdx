Thanks to the `now dns` CLI command, managing existing DNS records with ZEIT Now is simple.

<Note>
  This only applies to domains you bought via ZEIT or domains configured with
  our <GenericLink href="/dns">global DNS service</GenericLink>.
</Note>

## Using Now CLI

In the examples shown below, the placeholder `zeit.rocks` represents a domain of your choice that was registered with [`now domains`](/docs/v2/custom-domains). Here are the sub-commands you can use:

### now dns ls

Lists all the DNS records available for this domain. The list doesn't include records generated automatically by the nameserver (like a default `SOA` record or `A / AAAA` records created automatically for `ALIAS` records).

### now dns add

Adds a DNS record to a domain of your choice. The following record types are currently supported:

- A
- AAAA
- ALIAS
- CAA
- CNAME
- MX
- SRV
- TXT

This is the syntax for the `now dns` command.

<Snippet
  dark
  text="now dns add <domain> <name> <record type> <value> [mx_priority]"
/>

- `<domain>` is the domain name
- `<name>` is the subdomain that will be prefixed to `<domain>` (value `@` refers to a domain without any prefix)
- `<record type>` contains one of the supported record types shown above
- `<value>` indicates the value for the record (like an IP address or a hostname)
- `[mx_priority]` sets the priority of a certain MX record and can therefore only be used in conjunction with this record type
  <br />

**Examples**

<Snippet dark text="now dns add zeit.rocks ext A 127.0.0.1" />

Creates an A record that makes the subdomain `ext.zeit.rocks` resolve to the server located at the IP address `127.0.0.1.`

<Snippet dark text="now dns add zeit.rocks @ MX mail.awesome-now.us 10" />

Creates an MX record which makes the mail server located at `mail.awesome-now.us` responsible for handling emails sent to an address suffixed with `@zeit.rocks`.

<Snippet dark text={`now dns add zeit.rocks @ CAA '0 issue "comodo.com"'`} />

Creates a [CAA record](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/caa/) that allows issuing certificates using [Comodo](https://ssl.comodo.com/) for `zeit.rocks` and any subdomain under it.

> In this case, you'll be in charge of certificate management for your domain.<br/>
> Most probably, you'll need to use `CAA` records to:
>
> 1. use a custom certificate for your Now deployment with `now certs issue --ca`
> 2. run an app outside of Now with TLS for a subdomain

### now dns rm &lt;ID>

Removes a record by ID, which is shown in the `now dns ls` listing. Note that it may take a couple of hours before the change is fully propagated across our infrastructure.

### now dns import &lt;your-domain> &lt;zonefile>

Imports the zone file downloaded from your registrar for this domain to ZEIT DNS.
