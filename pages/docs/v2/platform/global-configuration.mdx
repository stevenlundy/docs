</Note>

Using the following files and configuration options, you can configure all Now clients ([Now CLI and Now Desktop](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation)) under your system user.

There are two global configuration files: `config.json` and `auth.json`. By default, these files are held in a directory named `.now` within the user's home directory. For example on Unix based systems they will be found at `~/.now/*.json`.

## config.json

This file is used for global configuration of Now deployments. Both Now CLI and Now Desktop use this file as a way to co-ordinate how deployments should be treated, consistently.

The first option is a single `_` that gives a description to the file, if a user should find themselves looking through it without context.

The following options are all of the options that can be used by users to configure their Now deployments globally on their system for that user profile:

### `updateChannel`

**Type**: `String`.

**Valid values**: `stable` (default), `canary`.

This option tells Now Desktop which channel it should look for updates on for both Now Desktop and, if [`desktop.updateCLI`](#updatecli) is enabled, Now CLI.

By default, the update channel is `stable` but by using `canary` you will get access to the latest pre-released features to test before they are officially released.

<Example>
  <Code lang="json">{`{
  "updateChannel": "stable"
}`}</Code>
</Example>

### `currentTeam`

**Type**: `String`.

**Valid values**: A [team ID](/docs/api/#endpoints/teams/list-all-your-teams).

This option tells both Now CLI and Now Desktop which context is currently active. If this property exists and contains a team ID, that team is used as the scope for deployments, otherwise if this property does not exist, the user's personal account is used.

<Example>
  <Code lang="json">{`{
  "currentTeam": "team_ofwUZockJlL53hINUGCc1ONW"
}`}</Code>
</Example>

### `api`

**Type**: `String`.

**Valid values**: [An API Origin URL](/docs/api/#api-basics/server-specs/origins).

This option selects which API Origin both Now CLI and Now Desktop should use when performing an action requiring the API.

<Example>
  <Code lang="json">{`{
  "api": "https://api-sfo1.zeit.co"
}`}</Code>
</Example>

### `desktop`

**Type**: `Object`.

This is an object that contains configuration options relating only to Now Desktop. The following options can be used:

#### `shownTips`

**Type**: `Object`.

This is an object that contains the configuration properties for which tips should be shown when using Now Desktop. The following options can be used within this object:

##### `pasteFromClipboard`

**Type**: `Boolean`.

**Valid values**: `true`, `false` (default).

This option allows the display of the "paste from clipboard" tip which teaches how to deploy with Now Desktop using the clipboard.

This default value of this option is `false` (or the option will not exist) unless the tip has been closed within Now Desktop, in which case this option will hold the value `true`.

<Example>
  <Code lang="json">{`{
  "desktop": {
    "shownTips": {
      "pasteFromClipboard": true
    }
  }
}`}</Code>
</Example>

#### `updateCLI`

**Type**: `Boolean`.

**Valid values**: `true`, `false` (default).

This option tells Now Desktop whether to keep Now CLI up-to-date while the app is open. If the value is `true`, Now Desktop will install updates for Now CLI based on the [update channel](#updatechannel).

<Example>
  <Code lang="json">{`{
  "desktop": {
    "updateCLI": true
  }
}`}</Code>
</Example>

#### `teamOrder`

**Type**: `Array`.

**Valid values**: A [list of team slugs](/docs/api/#endpoints/teams/list-all-your-teams) that the active user is part of, and the username or email of the active user.

This option defines the order that teams are shown in the footer of Now Desktop. The order of this array can change by dragging or dropping the avatars in Now Desktop or re-ordering this list.

<Example>
  <Code lang="json">{`{
  "desktop": {
    "teamOrder": ['timothy', 'zeit', 'now-examples', 'hyper']
  }
}`}</Code>
</Example>

#### `collectMetrics`

**Type**: `Boolean`.

**Valid values**: `true` (default), `false`.

This option defines whether [Now CLI](/download) should collect anonymous metrics about which commands are invoked the most, how long they take to run, and which errors customers are running into.

<Example>
  <Code lang="json">{`{
  "collectMetrics": true
}`}</Code>
</Example>

## auth.json

This file should not be edited manually. It exists to contain the authentication information for the Now clients.

In the case that you are uploading your global configuration setup to a potentially insecure destination, we highly recommend ensuring that this file will not be uploaded, as it allows an attacker to gain access to your provider accounts.
