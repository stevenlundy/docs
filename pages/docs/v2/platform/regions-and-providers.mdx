The Now Platform acts as a Universal API and Overlay Network on top of existing cloud infrastructure providers.

In some cases, the routing layer is in a different region from where [Now Lambdas](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas) are invoked. The roundtrip latency between them is usually in the 1 millisecond to sub-millisecond range.
