The Now Platform 2.0 simplifies and streamlines the deployment of static and serverless workloads.

Compared to 1.0:

- There are **no** **deployment types**. A single deployment can have multiple static and [dynamic entrypoints](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas), even written in multiple different [languages](#migration-examples).
- Your app's source code can be structured as a **monorepo**. No need to think in terms of microservices, multiple repositories, composition via YAML files, services meshes, etc.
- Multiple [**parallel builds**](/docs/v2/deployments/builds#parallelization) can be specified to compile source into [static files or serverless Lambdas](/docs/v2/deployments/builds#sources-and-outputs). These builds are written as [Builders](/docs/v2/deployments/builders/overview) in JS and can be easily used and shared.

Migrating your projects to 2.0 will result in:

- Massively improved reliability and scalability.
- Much lower prices.
- Simpler codebases thanks to [Builders](/docs/v2/deployments/builders/overview).
- Faster build times due to [build parallelization](/docs/v2/deployments/builds#parallelization) and [build deduplication analysis](/docs/v2/deployments/builds#deduplication-analysis).
- Faster cold boot times due to [increased granularity](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas#per-entrypoint-granularity).

<Note>
  v1 is fully maintained and supported. We will only announce a deprecation date
  once we have ensured all our customers workloads are migrated and the tooling
  is in place for a smooth transition.
</Note>

## Changes Overview

### Platform Versioning

We have introduced a strict notion of [platform version](/docs/v2/platform/overview#versioning). All existing users are locked to `1` to ensure there is no negative disruption to existing workflows.

Go to your [user and team settings](/account) to upgrade your account or team to **Latest**. After you do so, all new deployments will always use the most recent version (`2`). This is also the default for all new teams and accounts.

If you want to retain certain projects on v1, or pin your platform version, we recommend updating your `now.json` accordingly before you make the switch:

```json
{
  "version": 1
}
```

For a smooth deployment experience in the future, we recommend all upgraded projects to explicitly set the `version` field (e.g.: to `2`). Our clients and GitHub bots will remind you as well. If Now upgrades to a version `3` in the future, all your existing projects will work correctly even if your team or account setting is **Latest.**

### Free Tier

The free tier was previously named `OSS`. It's now known as `Free` and it doesn't imply a public visibility of source code nor logs. That feature needs to be manually triggered via the `--public` flag.

### Free seats

- The owner of a team no longer pays for a seat
- Teams with up to 5 members don't pay for a seat
- Team seat price has been adjusted

### Reduced prices

The following prices were drastically reduced:

- Cost of compute.
- Cost of DNS and CDN zones.
- Cost of logging (no more storage costs, charged [per-line](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas#capabilities-and-limits) and [strictly](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas#capabilities-and-limits) ephemeral).

### Fully on-demand

Plans are no longer available for selection. Users on the legacy plans will continue to be on those plans until they are phased out.

The only two subscription types available now are `Free` and `Unlimited`. If you upgrade to the unlimited plan and are still running v1 deployments, they will be billed according to the [prior on-demand plan](/pricing/v1).

### No Types

There is no notion of _types_ of deployments anymore. Previously, deployments could be of types:

- `STATIC`
- `NPM`
- `DOCKER`

From now on, the deployment `type` is no longer used and not exposed via the relevant [GET API endpoint](/docs/api/v2#endpoints/deployments/get-a-single-deployment).

We can still accomplish the dynamism of the `NPM` and `DOCKER` deployment types but associating source files with [Builders](/docs/v2/deployments/builders/overview) that can output individual [Lambdas](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas).

This in turn enables:

- Monorepo support
- Multiple programming languages and frameworks to co-exist
- Faster cold boot-up times due to refined [entrypoint granularity](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas#per-entrypoint-granularity)
- Faster build times by greater [parallelization](/docs/v2/deployments/builds#parallelization) and [deduplication](/docs/v2/deployments/builds#deduplication-analysis)

## No Daemons

Running a process persistently as a _daemon_ requires a lot of operational overhead, such as setting up readiness checks, health checks and close monitoring.

While v2 will not support this as a primitive, we still plan to address the following use-cases directly that our customers typically use processes for:

- Control and sync loops. A series of tasks that execute sequentially to verify or synchronize some remote state.
- Scheduled jobs. E.g.: a task that needs to run every 50 minutes.
- Jobs consumed from a queue.

We believe that these use-cases can be modeled and executed on much more effectively by taking full advantage of the serverless paradigm.

To help our customers in the transition, we won't announce a deprecation date for v1 until these additional features are generally available.

### No Instances

With Now v2 we're removing the notion of a **deployment instance**. There's no need to keep track of them and they just add overhead to the UI and database.

While it's still very useful to think about what happens when an [instance of a container](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas/#versus-processes-and-containers) is running or not as it pertains to hot vs cold invocation of [Lambdas](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas), attempts to count or enumerate instances in a UI are impractical and not very beneficial to the developer experience.

### No Config Mutability

Static assets and caches are served from our [Global CDN](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/cdn-and-global-distribution) automatically. When it comes to code invocation with [Lambdas](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas), it makes sense to think about whether the code is executed in a single region or multiple.

We support the [`regions`](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration#regions) parameter in `now.json` to this end. When you make a deployment and Lambdas are produced in the [build steps](/docs/v2/deployments/builds), we deploy them to the specified regions.

However, in the past we allowed for mutating these settings without re-deploying:

<TerminalInput>
now scale sfo my-deployment.now.sh
</TerminalInput>
<Caption>The <InlineCode>now scale</InlineCode> command is <P.B>no longer supported</P.B>.</Caption>

Due to our [deduplication system](/docs/v2/deployments/builds#deduplication-analysis) which prevents re-building and re-uploading unnecessarily at any given step, re-deploying code to different regions is now fast and practical.

Mutation is therefore going away, in favor of just changing `now.json` (locally or with a [Pull Request](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github)) and creating a new deployment instantly.

### No Singleton Builds

Previously, one could define a global build step or set of steps that run serially upon deployment. This could be done for example with a `build` step in `package.json`.

While effective, this meant constraining a project to serial execution. Serverless, however, allows for massive parallelization.

With Now 2.0, your build steps are specified as a list of `builds` inside `now.json`.

For example, say you want to build 2 sub-projects statically and 2 APIs wrapped as Lambdas:

```json
{
  "builds": [
    { "src": "gatsby-site/package.json", "use": "@now/static-build" },
    { "src": "react-static/package.json", "use": "@now/static-build" },
    { "src": "*.go", "use": "@now/go" },
    { "src": "*.js", "use": "@now/node" }
  ]
}
```

The build process will happen in parallel and the deployment shows all the resulting output files and Lambdas: `deployment url`

### Index behavior changes

Previously, if **a single file** was deployed (with any name, like `file.jpg`), our indexer would make it accessible as both `/` and `/file.jpg`.

While this is desirable for the purpose of quickly sharing a static file, e.g.:

<TerminalInput>now file.jpg</TerminalInput>

We've decided to make this logic happen on the client side, instead of the server side. Now CLI will define an item in `routes` that also maps `/` as a special case.

Furthermore, we have redesigned the directory listing style and added a new icon to represent [Lambdas](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas):

<Image src={`https://assets.zeit.co/image/upload/v1541620549/front/docs/v2-upgrade/lambda-icon.png`}
width={1456/2}
height={962/2}
/>
<Caption>The new Lambda icon shows in the source view of deployments to show which files are Lambdas.</Caption>

### Universal Now, in the Cloud

The client-side features for multi-cloud access on [Now CLI](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation#now-cli) are effectively deprecated, in order to move them to the server side.

During early testing of that feature, we found serious user experience and security challenges.

Instead, we will address this user need by:

- Focusing on providing open-source [Builders](/docs/v2/deployments/builders/overview) that allow for your code to be free from proprietary APIs
- Allowing for fine-grained access into the resources we provision with the [cloud infrastructure providers](/docs/v2/platform/regions-and-providers)
- Important features for interoperability such as VPC support
- Transparent and clear documentation about [regions and providers](/docs/v2/platform/regions-and-providers)

### `.nowignore`

Previously, the CLI had to implement complicated logic to determine whether to use `.npmignore`, `.dockerignore` or fall back to `.gitignore` if present, according to deployment type when uploading your [source files](/docs/v2/deployments/builds#sources-and-outputs).

Because deployment types are gone, we have simplified the logic to narrow down to: if there's a `.nowignore` file, it will be used to determine what files to include or exclude.

The `.nowignore` spec is the exact same as `.gitignore`. We recommend using it as a **whitelist** rather than a blacklist to avoid surprises.

```
*
!index.htm
!api/**
```

<Caption>
  This example first ignores every file and then whitelists which ones to
  include.
</Caption>

The `files` property in `now.json` is similarly deprecated, as to retain a singular source of truth for what files to include or exclude.

### Configuration (`now.json`)

**Additions:**

- [`version`](/docs/v2/platform/overview#versioning) to specify the platform version the deployment is known to work with.
- [`routes`](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration#routes) to define routes and rewrites.
- [`builds`](/docs/v2/deployments/builds) to define parallel build tasks.

**Removals:**

- ~~`sessionAffinity`~~ is no longer applicable due to the focus on statelessness. The current behavior is also aligned with the previous default affinity mode.
- ~~`type`~~ is no longer necessary since there are no types or modes going forward.
- ~~`engines`~~ is no longer applicable (belonged to the `NPM` deployment type).
- ~~`registryAuthToken`~~ is no longer applicable (belonged to the `NPM` deployment type).
- ~~`files`~~ is removed in favor of the `.nowignore` file.
- ~~`dotenv`~~ is removed in favor of [defining them directly inside the deployment configuration](/docs/v2/deployments/environment-variables-and-secrets/#from-now.json). The package [now-env](https://github.com/zeit/now-env) can be used to load environment variables from deployment configurations to be used in development.

Additionally, some environment variables keys are now reserved. You can see a full list of these variables in the [Environment Variables](/docs/v2/deployments/environment-variables-and-secrets/#reserved-variables) document.

### Environment Variables

**Removals**

- ~~`NOW`~~ is no longer assigned. Please use [NOW_REGION](/docs/v2/deployments/environment-variables-and-secrets#built-in-variables) variable as a confirmation method instead.
- ~~`NOW_URL`~~ is no longer assigned. Please use the `x-now-deployment-url` HTTP Request Header instead.

### CLI

**Removals:**

- ~~`--links`~~ is no longer supported when deploying. The feature had very niche use-cases and was limited in effectiveness.
- ~~`now scale`~~ is no longer necessary for v2 and deprecated. If you wish to change the regions your Lambdas get deployed to, use the [`regions`](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration#regions) config and re-deploy.
- Custom providers are removed, as we shift the strategy to executing the cross-provider logic from our backend instead.

## Don't rush to upgrade

The v1 platform is fully supported and maintained. v2 is superior in nearly every way, but some new features are necessary to completely map some legacy use cases. Most notably, APIs to support [loops and jobs](#no-daemons).

### Ask for help

### Serverless is better without Servers

It might be tempting to use the `now/node-server` Builder, as seen in [the example above](#migration-examples), to quickly deploy your app as a Lambda without any code changes.

Keep in mind, however, that one of the benefits of the serverless model, as the name implies, is not only **not to manage servers**, but also not to think in terms of **the server abstraction**.

In other words, if you are writing `new Server()` (in whatever language you prefer), you might be missing out on the [**granularity benefits**](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas#per-entrypoint-granularity) of serverless.

For example, many people have throughout the years provided examples on how to deploy [express](https://expressjs.com), a Node.js framework, to AWS Lambda:

```js
app.get('/', myFunction)
app.get('/2nd-route', myOtherFunction)
app.get('/third-route', myThirdFunction)
```

With Now, you can split this into three discrete underlying Lambdas instead, which allows for:

- Reduced surface of error
- Faster cold boot times thanks to smaller bundle sizes (_"code splitting" for the backend_)
- Per-route scalability
- Faster build and, therefore, total deployment times

[As seen above](#serverless-is-better-without-servers), the code changes required to leave servers behind altogether are very minimal, while the benefits very significant.
