A project is a logical structure that groups deployments and aliases inside of an account or team, based on the name of the project. This structure allows easier tracking and managing of deployments.

The projects structure enables faster locating of [deployments logs, source](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/special-paths), and [aliases](/docs/v2/domains-and-aliases/aliasing-a-deployment).

## Creating a Project

A project can be created either from the ZEIT account or team dashboard, by using [Now CLI](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation), or automatically when [deploying](/docs/v2/deployments/basics).

### 1. From the Dashboard

Simply visit [the ZEIT dashboard](/dashboard)(optionally selecting a team from the team picker), then click on the "Projects" link in the dashboard navigation.

Then you can create a project by just giving a name.

### 2. With Now CLI

You can create project by just typing the following command:

<TerminalInput>{`now projects add <your-project-name>`}</TerminalInput>

<Note>
  You need to download the latest version of Now CLI in order to run the above
  command.

### 3. Automatic Project Creation

This is simplest way to create a project as it does not require any action from the user. A project will automatically be created when making a deployment using the [defined name](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/urls#deployment-name).

(To select a project for a deployment, check the following section)

## Selecting an Existing Project for a Deployment

When [deploying an app](/docs/v2/deployments/basics), you can select an existing project for it. To do this, either:

### 1. Select the Project from Now CLI

Use the `--name` option to mention the project name as follows:

<TerminalInput>{`now --name <your-project-name>`}</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Deploying the current directory with Now CLI and <InlineCode>--name</InlineCode> option.</Caption>

### 2. Select the Project via `now.json`

You can specify the project for your deployment by using [the `name` property](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration#name) of the `now.json`

```json
{
  "name": "<your-project-name>",
  "version": 2
}
```

    platform version
  </GenericLink>
  .
</Caption>

### 3. Automatic Project Selection

If you didn't specify a project name explicitly via one of the above methods, we try to select a project automatically based on following rules:

- If this is GitHub deployment, we use the GitHub repo name as the project
- If this is a Now CLI based deployment, we use the directory name of your app as the project
- If this is a file or a set of files, we use the `files` project

## Deleting a Project

You can remove a project and all of the deployments contained within it with the following Now CLI command:

<TerminalInput>{`now projects rm <your-project-name>`}</TerminalInput>

<Note alert label="Note">
  This will also delete the deployments from the project. If you have any
  deployments that are aliased and do not want them to be removed, make sure to
  deploy them under a different project and alias them there first.
</Note>
