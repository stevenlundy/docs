The content of any path that does not contain an **Index File** (within a deployment) is rendered using our **Directory Listing**.

Here is an example of how this could look like:

  width={1232/2}
  height={764/2}
/>

As you can see, the directory listing contains three items:

- `first.php` and `second.php` are **Lambdas**
- `third.png` is a **Static File**

However, no **Index File** is present. If one would be present, the path of the **Directory Listing** would render that file instead.

## Index Files

**Index Files** are rendered in place of the path of the directory they are located in.

For example, visiting the path `/about` will serve the index file located in the `about` directory if it exists. This is typically `/about/index.html`.

Files that match all of the following criteria will be identified as an index:

- The file name is either `index` or `index.<extension>` (where `<extension>` is any file extension of your choice).
- The file name **does not** end with a `.` or contain multiple `.` in a row.

If multiple files match this pattern, `index.html` will take precedence followed by shortest to longest file names. That means `index.js` will take precedence over `index.bundle.js`.

## Types of List Items

There are two types of list items (which matches the **Output** of a **Build**):

- **Static Files** (indicated with a blank or picture icon)
- **Lambdas** (indicated with a Î» icon)

## Disabling the Directory Listing

The **Directory Listing** will only occur if there is no **Index File** at the path the client is trying to access.

By placing an **Index File**, set to look like a "Not Found" error page, inside the **Directory Listing** path, it will be indicated to visitors of your site that the location does not exist, rather than showing the **Directory Listing**.

## Rewrite To a 404 Page

To hide **Directory Listings** using a 404 using advanced configuration, you can use the [`routes`](/docs/v2/advanced/configuration#routes) property in a `now.json` file at the root of your project:

```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/example",
      "dest": "/404.html",
      "status": 404
    }
  ]
}
```

In the example above, the `/example` route (which is a directory without an **Index File**, thus would render a **Directory Listing**) is rewritten to render the `/404.html` file instead.

Furthermore, ZEIT Now sets a status code of `404` to accompany the response.
