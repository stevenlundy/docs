If you want a brand new domain to use with your Now deployments, you can buy one directly from Now and have it setup automatically on your account without any further need of setup.

When buying a domain, it may take a few minutes to setup and propagate before it is ready to use. In this time, the domain will show as external when you see it in Now CLI or from the Web UI.

### From the Web

Using the [ZEIT domains page](/domains) you can search for an available domain and then add it to your account in an instant. The domain will automatically be setup, ready for you to alias your deployments to.

Once the domain is bought, it will automatically be verified (this may take a few minutes) and available for you to alias your deployments.

You can see your domain in your account by using the `now domains ls` command or checking the setup status by using the `now domains inspect` command.

## Using Domains

With a domain in account or team, the next step is to alias a deployment to that domain.
