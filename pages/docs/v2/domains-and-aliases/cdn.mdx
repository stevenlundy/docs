The Now CDN is enabled automatically for both the [Free and Unlimited plans](/pricing). Your deployments will benefit from automatic immutable static caching, upon request in a [region](/docs/v2/platform/regions-and-providers), and if supplying [Cache-Control headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control), all dynamic responses from lambdas will also be cached in all regions.

## Caching

The Cache-Control header can include a number of directives, separated by comma.

Caching directives break down the caching controls into three categories:

### Purging

When aliasing, we automatically purge the cache so that no stale content is ever delivered.

#### Expiration

- `max-age=<seconds>` indicates when response is to be considered stale. It is represented in seconds since it was downloaded from the origin server.
- `s-maxage=<seconds>` indicates when the response is to be considered stale by shared caches. It takes precedence over `max-age`.
- `no-cache` indicates the response MUST NOT be used to satisfy a subsequent request without successful validation on the origin server.

### Revalidation

- `must-revalidate` indicates that once it has become stale, a cache (client or proxy) MUST revalidate the content before using the cached entry.
- `proxy-revalidate` has the same definition as the `must-revalidate` directive, except that it only applies to shared caches.
- `stale-while-revalidate=<seconds>` indicates that caches MAY serve the response in which it appears after it becomes stale, up to the indicated number of seconds since the object expired.
- `stale-if-error=<seconds>` indicates that when an error is encountered, a cached stale response _may_ be used to satisfy the request, regardless of other freshness information.

## Other

- `no-transform` indicates that an intermediary proxy and/or cache must not transform the payload.
- `immutable` indicates to clients that the response body will not change over time.

## Recommendations

We recommend leveraging shared caches over client caches. For example, `Cache-Control: max-age=0, s-maxage=86400` may be used to instruct shared caches to cache for 86400 seconds and clients to not cache. Similarly, `Cache-Control: max-age=60, s-maxage=86400` instructs shared caches to cache for 86400 seconds and clients to cache for 60 seconds.

## Bypassing cache

If no `Cache-Control` response header is present, the Now routing layer adds `Cache-Control: s-maxage=0`, to ensure that no shared caches will cache content that wasn't explicitly marked as cacheable.

Any request where the client appends an `Authorization` or `Pragma` header will bypass the cache.

The cache is also always skipped when an [HTTP cookie](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies) named `_now_no_cache` is present or if a [query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string) parameter named `_now_no_cache=1` is present.
