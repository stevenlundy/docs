Getting started with development using Now is simple and only requires a **single command** - `now dev`.

`now dev` is the **single command development experience** created with the aim of maximizing your productivity by simulating our Now platform locally.

To get started with `now dev`, you will need the [Now CLI](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation#now-cli). If you have not installed it yet, please refer to the [installation instructions](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation) (otherwise, run `yarn add global now` if Node.js is installed).

<Note>
  <InlineCode>now dev</InlineCode> requires Now 2.0 and the latest version of
  the <GenericLink href="/guides/updating-now-cli/">Now CLI </GenericLink>
  to work. If you are currently using Now 1.0, you should consider
  <GenericLink href="/docs/v2/platform/upgrade-to-2-0/"> upgrading</GenericLink>
  .
</Note>

## Key Concepts

### Development Secrets

When working on a project with `now dev`, it is extremely important that you **do not use any production secrets** (like your database credentials, for example).

Instead, you should use [secrets](/docs/v2/development/environment-variables) that are specific to the development environment and cannot cause any production damage. Those can be set in one of two files:

- `.env` contains environment variables used during **runtime**
- `.env.build` contains environment variables used during **buildtime**

<Note>
  It is also possible to define environment variables in your{' '}
  <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file.
</Note>

### Production-Like Environment, Locally

By mimicking the behavior of the Now platform in almost every way, `now dev` **decreases the chance of unexpected surprises** when deploying to a minimum.

Out of the box, `now dev` simulates the same model for [routing](/docs/v2/deployments/routes/), concurrency, and execution, and even accepts the exact same [`now.json` configuration](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration/).

### Custom Development Environment

If your project is built using the `@now/static-build` Builder or you are going to set up a project that is built statically when deployed; you can define custom development behavior for what `now dev` and its associated environment should attach to when you are developing locally.

To do this, you can use a `now-dev` script inside of a `package.json` that is an entrypoint of the `@now/static-build` Builder.

For more information on this, [see the `@now/static-build` Builder documentation](/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/static-build-now-static-build#local-development).

## Your First Project

This guide shows you how to get started with local development in Now **in under a minute**.

To get your first project up and running, you will be using the [Now CLI](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation#now-cli). If you have not installed it yet, please refer to the [installation instructions](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation) (otherwise, run `yarn add global now` if Node.js is installed).

For your convenience, we have created a number of [examples](https://github.com/zeit/now-examples) that are ready to use with `now dev`. To create a project using an example, enter the following:

<TerminalInput>now init</TerminalInput>

This will load a list of examples for you to choose from:

<TerminalOutput><b>{`> Select example:`}</b> (Use arrow keys)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;apollo<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;bash<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;create-elm-app<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;create-react-app<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;docz<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;express<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;express-twitter-dreamify<br/>
<i style={{color: '#00C5C7', fontStyle: 'normal'}}>‚ùØ gatsby</i><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;go<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;go-image-to-ascii<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;gridsome<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;html-minifier<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;jekyll<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;markdown<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mdx-deck<br/>
(Move up and down to reveal more choices)
</TerminalOutput>
<Caption>Selecting a project using the <InlineCode>now init</InlineCode> command.</Caption>

For this guide we'll use Gatsby, you're free to use whichever project you'd like to, however.

<Note>
  If you choose a project that requires{' '}
  <GenericLink href="/docs/v2/development/environment-variables/">
    environment variables
  </GenericLink>
  , you will need to create these before using <InlineCode>now dev</InlineCode>.
</Note>

Once you have found a project you want to use, hit enter (if the list does not include what you are looking for, read about [adding it](https://github.com/zeit/docs#adding-a-new-guide)). You will then see a directory created containing the project starter you selected:

<TerminalOutput>
  <b>{`> Select example:`}</b>{' '}
  <i style={{ color: '#00C5C7', fontStyle: 'normal' }}>gatsby</i>
  <br />
  <i style={{ color: '#00C5C7', fontStyle: 'normal' }}>{`>`} Success!</i>{' '}
  Initialized <b>"gatsby"</b> example in <b>~/gatsby</b>.
</TerminalOutput>

Next, you should follow the option given in the terminal and use the following command:

<TerminalInput>cd gatsby && now dev</TerminalInput>

After a short build you will see a success message, you are now developing locally with Now!
