Now uses routes to define the behavior of how a request is handled on the routing side. For example, you might use a route to rewrite a URL to another, redirect a user, or apply a header with the response to a request.

A route can be defined within a project's [`now.json` configuration file](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration/#routes) as an object within an array assigned to the `routes` property, like the following which creates a simple rewrite from one path to another:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "routes": [{ "src": "/about", "dest": "/about.html" }]
}
```

## Routes Properties

Now Routes have multiple properties for each route object that help define the behavior of a response to each request to a particular path.

### `src`

**Type**: String supporting [PCRE Regex](https://www.pcre.org/original/doc/html/pcrepattern.html) and [Route Parameters](#route-parameters) like `/product/(?<id>[^/]+)`.

For each route, `src` is required to set the path which the behavior will affect.

The following example shows a `now.json` configuration that takes a `src` path and rewrites it to a [destination `dest` path](#dest).

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "routes": [{ "src": "/about", "dest": "/about.html" }]
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file with a{' '}
  <InlineCode>routes</InlineCode> property that rewrites one path to another
  upon request.
</Caption>

### `dest`

**Type**: String

`dest` is used to rewrite the [`src`](#src) path to another path.

[The example for the `src` property](#src) shows how both methods work together to create a rewrite.

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "routes": [{ "src": "/about", "dest": "https://about.me" }]
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file with a{' '}
  <InlineCode>routes</InlineCode> property that rewrites one path to another
  upon request.
</Caption>

<Note>
  You can point the <InlineCode>dest</InlineCode> path to any URL, including
  non-Now hosted URLs as shown in the code below.
</Note>

### `headers`

**Type**: Object

The `headers` property is an object supporting [HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers) as the keys, with the intended value as the key's value.

An example of using the `headers` property to add [shared caching](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control#Expiration) headers to all files in an `images` directory:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/images/.+", "headers": { "cache-control": "s-maxage=604800" } }
  ]
}
```

<Caption>
  Setting <InlineCode>cache-control</InlineCode> headers for all paths under an{' '}
  <InlineCode>images</InlineCode> directory with routes.
</Caption>

<Note>
  You can also add custom headers to your <InlineCode>routes</InlineCode>, these
  are defined in the same way.
</Note>

### `status`

**Type**: Integer

The `status` property defines the status code that Now should respond with when a path is requested.

For example, you can use this property in combinations with [the `headers` property](#headers) to create a redirect with the initial status code of 301 (Moved Permanently).

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/about.html",
      "status": 301,
      "headers": { "Location": "/about-us.html" }
    }
  ]
}
```

<Caption>

  property to provide a{' '}
  <GenericLink href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status">
    HTTP status code
  </GenericLink>
  .
</Caption>

<Note>
  In a redirect case as shown above, the <InlineCode>Location</InlineCode>{' '}
  property can also point to non-Now hosted URLs.
</Note>

<Card title="www. Redirect Guide" href="/guides/redirect-from-www">
  Create a redirect from the www. subdomain to your root domain.
</Card>

### `methods`

**Type**: Array

The `methods` property can be used to define what [HTTP request methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) a particular path accepts.

The value of this property can be any [HTTP request method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods), with the default being that the path can accept any method.

As an example, you can use this property when you have an API endpoint and only want to allow `GET` or `POST` request methods:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "routes": [{ "src": "/api/user.js", "methods": ["POST", "GET"] }],
  "builds": [{ "src": "*.js", "use": "@now/node" }]
}
```

<Caption>
  Accepting only <InlineCode>POST</InlineCode> and <InlineCode>GET</InlineCode>{' '}
  HTTP request methods on an API endpoint.
</Caption>

<Note>
  The above example uses the{' '}
  <GenericLink href="/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/node-js-now-node/">
    @now/node
  </GenericLink>{' '}
  Builder as an example of a <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> configuration
  that tells Now to build JavaScript files with Node.js and outputs them as{' '}
  <GenericLink href="/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas/">
    lambdas
  </GenericLink>
  .
</Note>

## Route Parameters

Using [PCRE Named Subpatterns](https://www.pcre.org/original/doc/html/pcrepattern.html#SEC16), or capture groups, you can capture part of a path and use it in either the [`dest`](#dest) or [`headers`](#headers) properties.

Using route parameters enables you to change the format of your URLs easily without needing complicated routing code.

For example, if you are using URL parameters but want to use a custom URL path you can use the following:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "routes": [{ "src": "/product/(?<id>[^/]+)", "dest": "/product?id=$id" }]
}
```

<Caption>
  Using a URL parameter in <InlineCode>src</InlineCode> and rewriting it as a
  custom URL path in <InlineCode>dest</InlineCode>.
</Caption>

This will take a URL, like `/product/532004` and rewrites it to `/product?id=532004` with the user seeing your custom URL in their browser.

<Note>
  Both <InlineCode>^</InlineCode>, asserting the start of the path string, and{' '}
  <InlineCode>$</InlineCode>, asserting the end of the path string, are implied
  and are not necessary to write.

</Note>

As another example, if you want to redirect from all paths under a certain directory but want to keep the path in the new location, you can use the following:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/posts/(.*)",
      "status": 301,
      "headers": { "Location": "/blog/$1" }
    }
  ]
}
```

  keeping the path in the new location.

## Testing Routes

You can use this [online visual PCRE tester](https://www.debuggex.com/?flavor=pcre) to quickly test your `src` paths before deploying them to Now.

An interactive PCRE Regex cheatsheet is also available at [Debuggex](https://www.debuggex.com/cheatsheet/regex/pcre).

## Cascading Order

Routes are applied in the order they are given in the `routes` array. Take the following configuration, for example:

```json
{
  ...
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/" },
    { "src": "/first-page", "dest": "/first-page.html" }
  ]
}
```

<Caption>
  An incorrect example <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file that will match
  all
  <InlineCode>routes</InlineCode> and rewrite them to <InlineCode>/</InlineCode>
</Caption>

In this configuration, since the first route matches all possible paths, the second route will never be applied. The order of these routes would have to switch for the latter route to apply to the `/first-page` path.

The correct configuration for all routes to take affect would be:

```json
{
  ...
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/first-page", "dest": "/first-page.html" },
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/" }
  ]
}
```

<Caption>
  A correct example <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file that will match all
  <InlineCode>routes</InlineCode>, only rewriting to <InlineCode>/</InlineCode> if
  there are no matches.
</Caption>

This type of configuration can be seen in [single-page applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) where custom paths need to route to the `index.html` file.

## Limits

There is a limit of 256 route objects within a `routes` array. If there are more than this limit, the deployment will fail.
