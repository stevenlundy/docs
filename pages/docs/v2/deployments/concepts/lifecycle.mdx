The lifecycle of a deployment determines its readiness to accept user requests and serve traffic.

From an [API](/docs/api) standpoint, each deployment has a `readyState` field which can take one of the following values:

- `INITIALIZING` a deployment in this state is waiting on [builds](/docs/v2/deployments/builds) to complete
  - `ERROR` one or more builds failed
  - `READY` builds completed successfully or none were specified

When a deployment is `READY`, our system guarantees that it can be served at any time and that all the underlying serverless functions are available in the specified [regions](/docs/v2/platform/regions-and-providers).

No further state transitions are necessary, and all deployment entrypoints are expected to be served within milliseconds.

#### Builds Lifecycle

When a deployment has more than one underlying [builds](/docs/v2/deployments/builds), each build has its own states and lifecycle.

Now CLI displays and updates the evolution of the builds' states until the deployment completes.

Each build process goes through:

- `INITIALIZING` the initial state
- `ANALYZING` to determine if the build has to be performed or it can be de-duplicated
  - `BUILDING` while executing the [Builder](/docs/v2/deployments/builders/overview) code
    - `UPLOADING` to upload the files and resulting lambdas
      - `DEPLOYING` to deploy the necessary files and functions
        - `READY` if the deployment is successful
        - `ERROR` if the deployment fails
      - `ERROR` if an upload fails
    - `ERROR` if an error occurs during the build code executions
  - `READY` if no build is necessary
  - `ERROR` if an error occurs during the analysis code execution
