A deployment is always associated with a unique URL and [a staging alias](/docs/v2/domains-and-aliases/aliasing-a-deployment). The unique URL has the following fundamental components:

- The deployment subdomain, made up of:
  - The deployment name
  - A UID
- The deployment suffix, which defaults to `now.sh` but is customizable with the [custom domain suffix add-on](/docs/v2/platform/add-ons#custom-deployment-suffix)

### Subdomain

The subdomain can be at most `63` characters.

### Project Name

When a deployment is created, it must [supply a project `name`](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration#name). If a name is not specified explicitly, Now will use either the directory name or repository name.

The name can take up, at most, `53` characters. It is always followed by a dash `-` and then the [UID](<#uid-(unique-identifier)>).

### UID (Unique identifier)

The UID is derived from a large cryptographically random number encoded as 9 alphanumeric characters.

### Suffix

The default suffix for all deployments is, by default, `.now.sh`. It is registered with Mozilla's [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/).

For enhanced isolation and security, we recommend configuring a [Custom Deployment Suffix](/docs/v2/platform/add-ons#custom-deployment-suffix).
