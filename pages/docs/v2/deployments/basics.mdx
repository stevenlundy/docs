A deployment represents a copy of your application hosted in our cloud platform, accessible to you and your users via HTTP/2.

The deployment process gets triggered by either an [API call](/docs/api), the `now` command, or `git push` if using our [GitHub integration](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github).

The deployment process involves two phases we handle on your behalf:

- Source code synchronization: we take your application sources and upload them
- Build steps execution: if you define build steps, we execute them and serve their outputs

The resulting deployment is:

- [Immutable](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/immutability)
- [Globally Distributed](/smart-cdn)
- [Serverless](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas/#conceptual-model)

### Your First Deployment

To make your first deployment, we are going to use the [Now CLI](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation#now-cli). If you have not installed it yet, please refer to the [installation instructions](/docs/v2/getting-started/installation) (otherwise, run `npm i -g now` if Node.js is installed).

We start by creating a directory in which to place our deployment sources. Open up [a terminal](https://hyper.is) and write the following:

<TerminalInput>mkdir -p my-app && cd my-app</TerminalInput>

We are now inside the `my-app` directory. Use your favorite text editor to create an `index.html` file with the following contents:

```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<marquee>This is my first Now Deployment</marquee>
```

All we have to do now is run `now` from within the `my-app` directory:

<TerminalInput>now</TerminalInput>

The output looks like the following and includes a deployment URL:

  height={762/2}
/>

Check the deployment for a live example: <https://my-app-prtypks27.now.sh/>

This URL is unique to the source code inside that directory. If you run `now` again, the same deployment is returned. This is why we call our deployments [immutable](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/immutability).

### Introducing a Build Step

When we created our deployment above, Now performed one phase: source code synchronization.

In most production applications, however, we typically want to transform sources into other outputs. Now supports two types of outputs:

- Other static files. For example, we can take `index.html` and minify it or optimize a PNG
- [Lambdas](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas) (Serverless). These are entry points that are invoked when requested, execute code and respond dynamically.

Let's add a function that will be executed whenever the user goes to `/date.js` that outputs the date.

Create a file `date.js` with the following contents:

```js
module.exports = (req, res) => {
  res.end(`The date is ${Date.now()}`)
}
```

And register a [Build](/docs/v2/deployments/builds) for it by adding the following to `now.json`:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [{ "src": "date.js", "use": "@now/node" }]
}
```

When we run `now`, the output will look as follows:

<Image
  src={`https://assets.zeit.co/image/upload/v1541628788/front/docs/deployments-basics/basic-deployment-build.png`}
  width={1394/2}
  height={762/2}
/>

If we go to <https://my-app-83iw09a84.now.sh/date.js> we will get dynamic output.

Interestingly, if we go to <https://my-app-83iw09a84.now.sh> (the root path), you will find that our `index.html` file is not showing, and instead we get a [**directory listing**](/docs/v2/routing/directory-listing):

width={1456/2}
height={880/2}
/>

It is important to understand that Now keeps track of [**sources and outputs**](/docs/v2/deployments/builds#sources-and-outputs). If you add the [special pathname](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/special-paths) `/_src` at the end of the deployment, you will be able to inspect them.

Notice that in the source view, in the output tab, a `date.js` lambda was built (identified with the icon Î»), but `index.html` is no longer present. This is a precaution Now takes when using Builds to prevent source files from being accidentally exposed to the outside world.

We can then use the `@now/static` build module to include our `index.html` file explicitly:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    { "src": "date.js", "use": "@now/node" },
    { "src": "index.html", "use": "@now/static" }
  ]
}
```

When we run `now` again, we will see all our outputs.
