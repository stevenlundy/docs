This Builder exposes a `dist` directory built from either of two methods:

- [Using a `package.json` file](#package.json-entry-point), the Builder installs its dependencies and executes the `now-build` script within, expecting a `dist` directory as [the build output](/docs/v2/deployments/builds#sources-and-outputs).
- [Using a shell file](#shell-file-entry-point), the Builder executes each of the instructions within, expecting an output of a `dist` directory as [the build output](/docs/v2/deployments/builds#sources-and-outputs).

The default expectation of the `dist` directory as the build output can [be configured to be another directory](#configuring-the-build-output-directory).

## When to Use It

This Builder is very useful when you have source files that when built will be served **statically**, but instead of pre-building yourself locally, or in a [CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration), Now will build it in the cloud every time you deploy.

<Note>
  If you need to deploy static files that do not need to be built; use the{' '}
  <GenericLink href="/docs/v2/deployments/official-builders/static-now-static">
    <InlineCode>@now/static</InlineCode> Builder
  </GenericLink>{' '}
  instead.
</Note>

## How to Use It

First, create a project directory where your source code will reside. This can be the root directory for your project or a sub-directory inside of a monorepo.

In this example, we will show you how to use `@now/static-build` to build a Next.js project statically and deploy it, with one command.

The following example will focus on configuring Now to deploy an existing project.

  </GenericLink>
  .
</Note>

### Static Builder Configuration for Next.js

Next.js uses npm dependencies, so to ensure a fresh build for each deployment, make sure both `node_modules` and `dist` are in [the `.nowignore` file](/docs/v2/deployments/ignoring-source-paths):

```
node_modules
dist
```

<Caption>
  Contents of a <InlineCode>.nowignore</InlineCode> file that prevents the{' '}
  <InlineCode>node_modules</InlineCode> and <InlineCode>dist</InlineCode>{' '}
  directories from uploading.
</Caption>

Finally, for Now to know what to execute, extend the `scripts` object in your `package.json` with the following `now-build` property:

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "now-build": "next build && next export -o dist"
  }
}
```

<Caption>
  An extended <InlineCode>scripts</InlineCode> object containing a{' '}
  <InlineCode>now-build</InlineCode> script with build instructions.
</Caption>

Notice that `@now/static-build`:

- Uses `package.json` as a way of getting dependencies and specifying your build.
- Will **only execute** your `now-build` script.
- Expects the output to go to `dist`, or the directory defined as the value of the [config option `distDir`](#configuring-the-build-output-directory).

Finally, tell Now that you want to execute a build for this deployment by creating [a `now.json` file](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration) with the following contents:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [{ "src": "package.json", "use": "@now/static-build" }]
}
```

<Caption>

  <GenericLink href="/docs/v2/platform/overview#versioning">
    Now platform version
  </GenericLink>{' '}
  and a build step using the <InlineCode>@now/static-build</InlineCode> Builder.
</Caption>

### Deployment

With the Builder configured in your project, you can deploy your project with Now whenever you [update your code](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github) and it will be built fresh each time.

Once deployed, you will receive a URL of your built project similar to the following: <https://static-next-btz2x20cw.now.sh/>

The example deployment above is open-source and you can view the code for it here: <https://static-next-btz2x20cw.now.sh/_src>

## Configuring the Build Output Directory

If you want to configure a directory other than `dist` for your build output, you can pass an optional `distDir` option in the builder's config:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@now/static-build",
      "config": { "distDir": "www" }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Monorepo Usage

The `@now/static-build` Builder can be used for multiple build steps in the same project. To build two Next.js websites, for example one in the root of the project and another in the `docs` directory, the following configuration would be used in a `now.json` file:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    { "src": "package.json", "use": "@now/static-build" },
    { "src": "docs/package.json", "use": "@now/static-build" }
  ]
}
```

## Technical Details

### Entry Point

The `src` value of each build step that uses the `@now/static-build` Builder can be either [a `package.json` file](#package-json-entry-point) with a `now-build` [script](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/package-json/#toc-scripts) or a shell file.

#### `package.json` Entry Point

The `package.json` entry point must contain a script within a `scripts` property called `now-build`. The value of this script must contain the instructions for how Now should build the project, with the result of the build's final output in the `dist` directory (unless [configured](#configuring-the-build-output-directory)).

For example, building a [statically exported Next.js project](https://nextjs.org/docs#static-html-export):

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "now-build": "next build && next export -o dist"
  }
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>scripts</InlineCode> property in a{' '}
  <InlineCode>package.json</InlineCode> file used to statically build an export
  Next.js.
</Caption>

This file accompanies [a `now.json` file](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration) with a build step that points to the `package.json` file as an entry point:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [{ "src": "package.json", "use": "@now/static-build" }]
}
```

<Caption>

  <InlineCode>package.json</InlineCode> file as an entry point.
</Caption>

#### Shell File Entry Point

Using a file with a `.sh` file extension as an entry point for the `@now/static-build` Builder allows you to define build instructions in a shell file.

For example, creating a shell file, with the name `build.sh`, with the following contents will install and build a [Hugo project](https://zeit.co/guides/deploying-hugo-with-now/):

```shell
yum install -y wget

wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.31.1/hugo_0.31.1_Linux-64bit.tar.gz
tar -xzf hugo_0.31.1_Linux-64bit.tar.gz

./hugo
```

<Caption>Example shell file that installs and builds a Hugo project.</Caption>

The `build.sh` file accompanies [a `now.json` file](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration) with a build step that points to the `build.sh` file as an entry point:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "build.sh",
      "use": "@now/static-build",
      "config": { "distDir": "public" }
    }
  ]
}
```

<Note>
  An example <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file that defines the entry point
  of a build step, using <InlineCode>@now/static-build</InlineCode>, as the
  above <InlineCode>build.sh</InlineCode> shell file.
</Note>

By default, Hugo builds to the `public` directory, so the `config` property contains an extra `distDir` option that sets the output directory for Now to look in after the build instructions of the `build.sh` file are finished.

Now will look for [the `dist` directory by default](#configuring-the-build-output-directory).

### Dependencies Installation

The installation algorithm of dependencies works as follows:

#### For `package.json` Entry Points

If [a `package.json` is used as an entry point](#package.json-entry-point), the following behavior applies for dependencies listed inside of it:

- If a `package-lock.json` is present in the project, `npm install` is used.
- Otherwise, `yarn` is used, by default.

#### For Shell Entry Points

`yum` is fully available to install any dependencies from within a [shell entry point file](#shell-file-entry-point).

For example, installing `wget` from a shell entry point and using it to install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), then unpacking Hugo with `tar`, which is built-in:

```shell
yum install -y wget

wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.31.1/hugo_0.31.1_Linux-64bit.tar.gz

tar -xzf hugo_0.31.1_Linux-64bit.tar.gz
```

### Private npm Modules

To install private npm modules, define `NPM_TOKEN` as a [build environment](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration#build-env) in `now.json`.

### Node.js Version

The Node.js version used is the latest in the **8 branch**.
