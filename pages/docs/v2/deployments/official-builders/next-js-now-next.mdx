<Tag>Status: Stable</Tag>

The Now Next.js Builder takes a [Next.js application](https://nextjs.org), defined by a `next.config.js` entrypoint and `pages` directory, and converts those pages into a series of individual [lambdas](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas).

It features built-in caching of `node_modules` and all compiler artifacts for very fast deployments.

## When to Use It

`@now/next` is the ideal way to ship a fast, production-ready [Next.js application](https://nextjs.org) that scales automatically.

For more information on why you should use Next.js for your project, see [the Next.js website](https://nextjs.org).

## How to Use It

The first step is to set up a Next.js project. If you have not yet done so; [the best place to get started is the Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/#setup).

To get started, make sure you have installed the Next.js dependencies with the following command:

<TerminalInput>yarn add next react react-dom</TerminalInput>

Then, in your project directory, create a `pages` directory with some example pages, for example; the home index page, `pages/index.js`:

```jsx
export default () => <div>Hello world!</div>
```

Create a simple `next.config.js` file to use as our entrypoint for the build, and to configure that the build should be a collection of serverless [lambdas](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas/):

```js
module.exports = {
  target: 'serverless'
}
```

<Note>
  The serverless method is only supported in{' '}
  <GenericLink href="https://nextjs.org/blog/next-8/#serverless-nextjs">
    Next.js version 8
  </GenericLink>{' '}
  and above.
</Note>

Then define a build step in a `now.json` configuration file:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [{ "src": "next.config.js", "use": "@now/next" }]
}
```

To prevent unintended issues and to speed up the uploading step of the deployment process, make sure to add both the `.next` and `node_modules` directories to [a `.nowignore` file](/docs/v2/deployments/ignoring-source-paths/).

[Upon deployment](/docs/v2/deployments/basics), you will get a URL like the following: <https://nextjs-8fnzfb1ci.now.sh>

Also, the source code of the deployment can be checked by appending `/_src` e.g. <https://nextjs-8fnzfb1ci.now.sh/_src>.

## Technical Details

### Entrypoint

The entrypoint of this builder is a `next.config.js` file with the `target` configuration option set to `serverless`.

```
module.exports = {
  target: "serverless"
}
```

This configuration, shown above, tells Next.js to build each page in the `pages` directory as a [lambda](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas/) function.

For more information on this, see [the Next.js documentation](https://github.com/zeit/next.js#serverless-deployment).

### Dependencies installation

The installation algorithm of dependencies works as follows:

- If a `package-lock.json` is present, `npm install` is used
- Otherwise, `yarn` is used.

### Private npm modules

To install private npm modules, define `NPM_TOKEN` as a [build environment](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration#build.env) in `now.json`.

### Node.js version

The Node.js version used is the **v8.10**.

### Custom Server

This builder separates your pages into individual serverless endpoints, so you cannot use a custom server.

Using a custom server would require that all pages be routed through that custom server and the application would lose out on many of the benefits of [serverless](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas/) Next.js. You can still achieve most of the logic that you have in a custom server by using [getInitialProps()](https://nextjs.org/docs/#fetching-data-and-component-lifecycle) and using [routes](/docs/v2/deployments/configuration/#routes).

### Maximum Lambda Bundle Size

To help keep cold boot times low, the [maximum output bundle size](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas#maximum-bundle-size) for a Next.js output lambda is, by default, **`5mb`**.
This [limit is extendable](/docs/v2/deployments/builders/overview#configuring-output-lambda-size) up to **`50mb`**.

<Example>
  <span>
    Example <InlineCode>maxLambdaSize</InlineCode> configuration:
  </span>
  <Code lang="json">{`{
  "builds": [
    { "src": "next.config.js", "use": "@now/next", "config": { "maxLambdaSize": "10mb" } }
  ]
}`}</Code>
</Example>

export default ({ children }) => <Doc meta={meta}>{children}</Doc>
