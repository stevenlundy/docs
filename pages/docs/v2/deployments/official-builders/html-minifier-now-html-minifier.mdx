This builder optimizes `.html` files using [html-minifier](https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier).

## When to Use It

When you want your HTML source files to be minified so they are as small as possible (without any semantic changes) in production.

## How to Use It

We'll define a `index.html` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h3>This is very long</h3>
  </body>
</html>
```

Then we'll define our build step to optimize our images:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [{ "src": "*.html", "use": "@now/html-minifier" }]
}
```

When we deploy with `now`, the resulting deployment URL will be live as <https://htmlproject-b2u4218wj.now.sh>.

Next, use `curl` to query the deployment URL, you will notice the HTML has been compressed:

```bash
▲  curl https://htmlproject-mf0azp0cg.now.sh/
<!doctype html><html lang=en><meta charset=UTF-8><title>Document</title><h3>This is very long</h3>
```

The example deployment above is open-source and you can view the code for it here: <https://htmlproject-b2u4218wj.now.sh/_src>.

## Technical Details

### Entrypoint

The entrypoint is always a `.html` file you want to optimize.
