This builder converts `.md` files into `.html`. It uses [remarkjs](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) under the hood.

## When to Use It

When you want to create quick static websites from Markdown source files.

## How to Use It

We will define a `index.md` file:

```markdown
# Hello World!

## This is a subheading.

An some content in markdown!
```

Then we will define our build step to optimize our images:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [{ "src": "*.md", "use": "@now/md" }]
}
```

That's it. The result looks like this: <https://markdown-deployment-bfc5zuwfx.now.sh>.

Also, the source code of the deployment can be checked by appending `/_src` e.g. <https://markdown-deployment-bfc5zuwfx.now.sh/_src>.

## Technical Details

### Entrypoint

The entrypoint is always an `.md` file you want to convert to HTML.

export default ({ children }) => <Doc meta={meta}>{children}</Doc>
